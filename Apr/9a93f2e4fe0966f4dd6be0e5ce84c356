THE situation at Mokopane Home Affairs in Limpopo worried DA leader Mmusi Maimane. He visited the offices on Tuesday afternoon before the by-election campaign in ward 16, Ga-Pila. On Friday, Daily Sun published a story about the Home Affairs officials who cut off the queues and only see 110 people a day. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssTjdK7LLDOjlDGavf26lzzWFRB6cXA5PjApccWxSGTsQuOABTPanvJv2vFzqu4IU2hczS6gMeLmompfvrvps4WuwqSjRQL4J1H0FyM4HLQxChEZzw0KxG2zOFZZHe1mLylgztRGkAycHkjJnAu-5RX4mqc7rZykecIqNJGZavJwcuhpz2XCNLUfl8kdTEaL1m4JWufAJQlppCSzSSuSnMo_odW-F9cLZ_hPqC_mE9boqGsKJpu3CAw0ZALil5KxshtLloCip_wF-vZ1h77m_SXDX10n9vJ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC65s1IB5TzOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Home Affairs officials told Maimane they are short staffed and lack resources.Maimane said he would talk to Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba about the matter.“If other residents in some provinces are helped within an hour of their arrival at the offices, why are the people of Limpopo suffering like this? It’s wrong because Batho Pele principles are not being practised here. There are people who arrived at this office before 7am but at 2pm they are still in the queue.” A Home Affairs official told Maimane they moved to the building as a temporary solution in the hope that a permanent structure would be built for them, but nothing happened. “Two other satellite offices died a slow death with no equipment and they were closed,” he said.When campaigning at ward 16 for the by-election, Maimane told supporters that if their preferred candidate was not doing what she promised, he would allow them to remove her. Roselyn Mogashane is the preferred candidate of the DA because an ANC councillor died.
