The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has passionately
defended its head, National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun
Abrahams against allegations by lobby group AfriForum, calling it "a
desperate campaign to besmirch" his image. Earlier on Wednesday, the group approached the Silverton
police station to have Abrahams charged with corruption, fraud, theft,
extortion and forgery.AfriForum alleged that Abrahams and other senior officials
were implicated in fraudulent travel claims. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstgo-IWPP4lrFphhOG-1I0LD4D4Idl_tiBK6_yPMMliBIsdqTAUt24gfgvNYylKCcrnuClobThQfLHe5ANyapL1_WKYBbR6_VonPAJQgkHOaqHP4wwAwRb1GEpnaQK2tE6jbilpTC23mGvmjzyY3958WWHkzWHhne807jy78y8hatsOi1Cj5N88ZiAGeJxwok-shw5Qni4dwV3y8DfSuSzF-rvkUj291FJgOXS33Vnx4PQ1onkSb-tTw1W0GsHzgfOpSXom_-KMC-5VqFLE5IpV1Zr2cdc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHsAvt4U2p8_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

specialised covert vehicle, by the Office for Witness Protection to the
national director, was in line with normal security practice. "It is vehemently denied that the vehicle was allocated
to the National Director for personal, private use. There was no corruption
whatsoever involved in the use of the vehicle," Mfaku said in a statement
on Wednesday.Â  He added that Abrahams never requested the enhancement of
his security detail.AfriForum received an anonymous letter that contains serious
allegations of criminal conduct. The group's anti-corruption unit head Monique Taute said in
a statement that one allegation was a covertly-funded fraudulent travel claim
from four members of the NPA. "The claim, submitted for authorisation to travel to
Zeerust, misrepresents the fact that they actually travelled to Cape Town and
spent R97 000 of these covert funds," Taute said. According to Taute, the letter alleges that a witness
protection vehicle was allocated to the NDPP, who used it for personal benefit.She added that Abrahams had "corruptly ensured a
personal and/or gratuitous official benefit, to which he is not entitled".The letter from "concerned NPA staffers who are opposed
to the misuse of power", was sent to AfriForum in March. The allegations
were reported to the anonymous anti-corruption hotline. According to the report
to the hotline in March 2017, allegations were also made against other senior
NPA officials.In February last year, the officials were supposed to go on
an official trip to Zeerust, the letter stated. Instead, they travelled to the
Western Cape and booked into a hotel for seven days. They allegedly submitted
fraudulent documentation when applying for the funding and stated that they
intended to go to Zeerust. It was also alleged that they spent R97 000 on
accommodation and food. The funds were allegedly withdrawn in one transaction
from a bank account holding covert funds.Taute requested the police to investigate the allegations
made in the anonymous letter.However, Mfaku said Dawood Adams, who is a special director
and the former head of the witness protection unit, was never in Zeerust or
Cape Town at the time and denied having submitted alleged fraudulent travel
claims. "The Integrity Management Unit (IMU) of the NPA has
been conducting investigations since 2017 regarding the allegations of
fraudulent subsistence and travel claims. "The IMU has a mandate to investigate allegations of
alleged misconduct by NPA officials and it is standard practice to refer
allegations of criminality to the police."SOURCE: NEWS24
