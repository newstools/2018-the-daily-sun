It seems the age old excuse of faking a headache has been given the red card by soccer fans with the more honest ‘I want to watch soccer’ as the most common way to get out of having sex, a study revealed.The British survey was commissioned by Durex as part of their #DontFakeIt campaign to highlight how soccer affects couples’ sex life. Researchers found that whilst being honest was favoured by most people, many are still likely to fake illness or injury to get out of having sex.Excuses such as, ‘I’ve got a bad back’ or ‘I’m too tired’, ‘I’ve got a headache’ and ‘I’ve been working late’ were added to the top five excuses.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The prospect of a big soccer match is exciting and for some not even the offer of bedroom action is going to get in the way of their viewing time.Researchers also discovered that despite the common perception of men rarely being the ones to turn down the offer of some action between the sheets, 40 percent admit they will reject their other half’s offer so they can watch the game instead.Even if they do get intimate with their partners, 42 percent will try to ‘get it over with quickly’ in order to leave them free to watch the game in peace. However, it also emerged that 37 percent would ditch the excuses and accept their partner’s offer of sex if they could still have the TV on to keep an eye on the pitch-side action at the same time.Durex believes nothing should get in the way of great sex, not even the beautiful game.  From the elaborate excuses people make in order to watch a game through to those on the pitch partaking in ever more melodramatic dives, Durex says no more. Sex and soccer should be a fake free zone. Bevan Lewis, Marketing Manager for the brand says,  “There is a stereotype that women often make excuses to avoid sex but according to these statistics when the game is on, the tables are turned. "Considering that 82 percent of South Africans believe that sex is beneficial to their health and well-being we encourage couples to turn back the attention on building intimacy and a satisfying sex life once the game is over.” SOURCE: Health24
