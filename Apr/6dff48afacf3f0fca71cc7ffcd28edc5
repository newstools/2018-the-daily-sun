Phinda is Vela's older brother. The court appeal centred around Mduduzi Shembe and his supporters – the Ebuhleni group – contesting a 2016 Durban court ruling that had declared his uncle, Vela Shembe (who has subsequently died), to be the legitimate leader of the church. Succession battle Mduduzi is the son of the late leader, Vimbeni Shembe.  Since Vimbeni’s death in March 2011, the two million-member church has been divided over who should be at its helm.ALSO READ: Shembe church must stay united after leader's death: SancoThe succession battle erupted at Vimbeni’s funeral when his close friend, Chief Mqoqi Ngcobo, announced that Vimbeni had confided in him on various occasions his wish for his son, Mduduzi, to succeed him.Moments later Vimbeni’s lawyer, Zwelabantu Buthelezi, produced a "nomination deed" allegedly signed by the late leader.
