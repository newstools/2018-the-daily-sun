department, the report said. SABC quoted The Observer newspaper that was owned by the
king, as saying that the vehicles were set to transport dignitaries at the
party.A blogger, Richard Rooney, also quoted Swaziland's
independent newspaper, the Times Sunday, as saying that "the cars would be
used by the Close Protection Unit which is responsible for protecting
dignitaries".According to Rooney, the newspaper did not say how many cars
had been purchased.SOURCE: NEWS24
