SIX years after they were evicted from farms they called home and moved to temporary structures, they’re still waiting for their RDPs. Residents of ward 7, in Komga near East London, have accused their councillor of failing to keep a promise he made in 2012 to provide proper housing. They said toilets are situated 100m from their houses and fear criminals will attack them while relieving themselves. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssRbrgNiC-cJGoJH_EfGrQPmbflnkM4hrYytfVjJfRpEhy_ElJsiDINNe6qyo5vYbuE1gQ7d-cl2_SLhiODuDv1XAswbF5ZHpqTSa8StAHlLOIXwU4mdbzLO56ptdy14r9moV5d6suOSRD3lsxKqA3OCZR6crsOe4yqTLtmv2e5GcQauJeK8_jRzljvGgaFGQWjJYhlsM7jmLpRzboV2BU4l4acviP_ifWZxxUVF0Sssl3yZ5vsn4EZulbQEtWw1msYGNKyeiMlzYNhGTuS358uIK3jdoA-\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLHC3oZTfEX-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

In the meantime, they’re expected to live in houses patched with dirty cardboard, and collapsing and wet ceilings. Nosinodi Tilolo (54), whose leg was amputated last year, has been living in the settlement since 2012. “We were at first promised we’d only be here for six months,” she said. “This is not a place for people to live. It’s a pigsty.” Mantombi Mthunyarha (77) said they live in the structures only because there is no alternative housing. Lwandile Sicwetsha, Eastern Cape Human Settlements spokesman, said they’re waiting for a district municipality bulk infrastructure project to supply water. “The project is 98% complete and there are 1 140 beneficiaries,” he told the People’s Paper.
