NOMATOMELA Sihawu is a happy gogo. The 82-year-old from Samora Machel, Cape Town, has been given a new wheelchair by DA members. The gogo will now be able to sit outside in the sun, something she couldn’t do before. Her daughter Nonkululeko (43) said she was grateful for the special gift for her sick mum, who can’t walk. “When the DA members came to our house and promised to donate a wheelchair for gogo, I didn’t believe them. “But they kept their promise.” Xolani Joja, a branch secretary of the DA, said they had been planning to help the gogo since last year. “Since we had already promised, we wanted to make sure we kept our promise,” said Joja. “We didn’t only want to donate any wheelchair, but one that would be helpful to the family. “It’s not only about sitting in the wheelchair. “The gogo will also be able to relieve herself and her daughter just has to clean the basin. “No more nappies during the day, and that will save the family a lot of money.” Councillor Thulani Stemela said they serve the community, especially the elderly. “We don’t need to be praised for doing our work. Residents voted for us to help them.”
