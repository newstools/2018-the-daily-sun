NO one understands the saying “necessity is the mother of invention” more than Tselane Mochesane and Lesego Selesho. They put their heads together after years of being jobless and now sell fast food next to the busy Moshoeshoe road in their kasi. Tselane (31) and Lesego (32) from Hostel One in Mangaung started their business in January. “We put together the little money we had and bought food to sell and now locals love our meals,” said Tselane. Lesego told Daily Sun she spent years at home, jobless. “It dawned on me that God had given me hands and a brain to use,” she said. “I saw a need because people in our kasi struggle to get hot fresh food, so we made sure we supplied their need. “We sell meat, pap and salads for R30 a plate. Business so far has been good, although not all days are the same.” She said their dream is to find a shelter from which to sell their food. They don’t make any money when it’s raining. Tselane said starting a business wasn’t easy, but what helped them was finding the right spot for their business. “My advice to other women is to open their own businesses, instead of waiting and hoping to get a job. The reality is that there are no jobs in our province,” she said.
