Born in 1936 in Bizana, Eastern Cape, she moved to Joburg where she began her studies as a social worker.She was implicated in the kidnapping of Stompie Seipei, who later died. Stompie was a 14-year-old political activist who was abducted by members of the Mandela United Football Club and brought to Winnie’s home.The radical teenager was accused of being a police informer. Stompie was beaten and later murdered by the team’s coach, Jerry Richardson.His death left a permanent mark on Madikizela-Mandela’s reputation. But she consistently denied any involvement and even appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This was despite a heartfelt appeal by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chaired the commission, for her to “say sorry”.Known to be a close friend of EFF leader Julius Malema, she had publicly spoken of her desire to one day see Malema back in the ANC fold.Sadly, Madikizela-Mandela died before she could realise that dream.
