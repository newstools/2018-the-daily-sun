The two men charged with public violence and malicious
damage to property following a pitch invasion at Moses Mabhida Stadium will
appear in the Durban Magistrates' Court on Monday. Moses Mabhida dissolved into chaos on Saturday night when
fans invaded the pitch following the Kaizer Chiefs' 2-0 loss to the Free State
Stars during the Nedbank Cup semi-final. Police had to use tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the
unruly fans that could be seen hurling chairs and beating security officials. Footage shows a security guard being severely beaten by
fans, leading to some on social media on Sunday speculating she may have died. "One security guard has been hospitalised, but I'm not
certain about the condition," said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile
Gwala. Crisis Medical spokesperson Kyle van Reenen told News24
earlier on Sunday that the security guard was seriously injured, but stable. Stadium management on Sunday said the guard was in fact a
man, contrary to reports that the guard was a woman. No woman was injured in
the incident, management said. The scenes were widely criticised on social media and by all
in the sporting community. Sports Minister Tokozile Xasa and the Premier Soccer League
were among those to slam the behaviour of the Kaizer Chiefs fans, and called on
Stadium Management South Africa to address the incident. Stadium Management SA on Sunday registered its "grave
concern" over the gruesome assault of the security guard. Due process must
be followed to get to the bottom of it. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/two-to-appear-in-court-for-moses-mabhida-stadium-violence-20180423-3
