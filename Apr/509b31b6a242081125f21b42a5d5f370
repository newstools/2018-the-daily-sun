MARITZBURG United coach Fadlu Davids says their 2-1 defeat to Bidvest Wits in an Absa Premiership match at Milpark on Tuesday was a wake-up call for his players to pull up their socks.The 36-year-old mentor reckons the defeat might prove a blessing in disguise for his youthful side that has done well this season by securing a spot in the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup and remains in the race for a top three league finish.They will need to overcome Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns on the weekend of 21 April if they are to reach the Ke Yona final.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuxYLfwQkMj2rVSHd5Gwve5ZUqZUglKi0_bjFPBgVwgyhvdg1DLcgWzEOX2FaoHj67nzT2AX5aGIgljTP7Zi1K1l1KU1dlcR77NACto5CAsAQaoYu7xETgEBF40BHs8f6lilg_Ocbear57TRjuNhduBqifBxPc-WW3c2q7ScXkGy27_O570mXFpj0eBZcT1VtkJDe44E1JlqW_rOo-zk4S4M9-LDG1CuvV64A2GQjjeFSRRNZCHg1RweGzWD4F2JRoqOpMY14u2yod_dyhw0Sb7cvI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNOzEUftSkfDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They were on a high and thought it would be easier. They were taught a lesson – it’s the perfect way to be brought down to earth. “It’s a tough schedule now – Cape Town City, Baroka, Sundowns twice, then Kaizer Chiefs, the last game against Golden Arrows – it’s quite tough and we need all our players fresh and injury-free.”Despite the setback, Davids believes they are still on the right track to finish the season in the top eight. “The target was to make Maritzburg a top eight club and not one battling relegation. We need one more win and a draw to consolidate our top eight position. So far our plan has been a success but there is so much to improve on.”He says the lack of depth in the team has now taken its toll. “We are using the fewest players in the league, they have a lot of minutes under their belt. Andrea Fileccia had an ankle injury, we hope he will be ready to play on Saturday.”
