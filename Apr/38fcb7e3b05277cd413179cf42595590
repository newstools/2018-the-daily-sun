The teenage Rain Queen Mosalanabo was accompanied by her uncle Mpapatla Modjadji, who is the regent.Ramaphosa said the recognition of queenship in the country shows the commitment to the principle and values of gender equality as well as the recognition of the leadership role that women play.“Our traditional leaders must be in the forefront to restore the dignity of our people. During the ANC’s national conference we took a resolution that land must also returned to its rightful people,” he said.He said they are looking into the recognition of the Balobedu language.Regent Mpapatla Modjadji said: “We are happy that we are now recognised and united so that we can build a good foundation for our growing queen. “Balobedu, we are lucky to have this government and we must support them,” he said.He said the government should be given a chance to do its work.“We all hope that our language is also recognised,” he said. Traditional dance groups and local artists including Candy and King Monada entertained the crowd.
