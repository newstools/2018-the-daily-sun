THERE may finally be light at the end of the tunnel for frustrated commuters in Mthatha. Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to meet with rival taxi associations to try and end weeks of chaos. Cele has arranged a meeting with members of the Uncedo Service and Border Alliance taxi associations today. The associations are expected to tell the minister they have made peace. Since 2016, taxi violence in the area has claimed more than 60 lives. Cele closed all taxi ranks in the area last month, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. Uncedo vice-chairman Mnikelo Mbopho said the fighting was over a route through a small village called Corhana on the R61. The route is between Mthatha and Port St Johns. “We have acknowledged our wrongdoing and we fixed our problems. Our association and Border agreed that we can both transport passengers in Corhana,” he said. Border secretary-general Vusumzi Mbewu said they were ready to meet Cele. Meanwhile, four accused linked to the taxi violence appeared in court this week. Vuyo Mahlombe (29), Kholwana Ntanjane (28), Mncedi Fasi (30) and Monelisi Fasi (45) appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates Court on Wednesday on charges of murder and attempted murder. They appeared in the Libode Magistrates Court yesterday on charges of murder, attempted murder, possession of illegal firearms and ammunition and possession of suspected stolen vehicles. They will appear in court again next week.
