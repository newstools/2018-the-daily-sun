KAMPALA, DRC - MANY kids fleeing the Democratic Republic of Congo have been raped on their way to neighbouring Uganda. Some have been raped at refugee camps in the east African country where more than 73 000 Congolese refugees have sought refuge. More than 2 800 kids have fled to Uganda. Save the Children has found that 10% of newly arrived kids said they were raped on their way to Uganda. The organisation interviewed 132 refugee children aged between 10 and 17 about their protection and education needs. It found that hunger was the biggest issue facing children fleeing the Democratic Republic of Congo, affecting 81% of them. Sickness affected more than half the number of fleeing kids. A quarter of children interviewed said they were assaulted by armed groups. Johnson Byamukama, director of Save the Children’s emergency response in Uganda, said child refugees arriving in the east African country daily were in desperate need. “Every one of them has a horrific story to tell, including of rape, of parents being killed and of witnessing extreme violence,” said Byamukama. Even after arriving in Uganda, the kids remain at risk of sexual violence, with a number of incidents reported around the refugee camps in recent weeks. The risk of sexual violence against children is highest while collecting firewood or water, on the way to school or while playing. – CAJ NEWS
