But I want to score as many as I can to add to my tally and see where I end up when the season’s over. But it’s not about me, it’s about helping the team achieve its goal first. “This season has been good to me and I feel I have done enough. My confidence is high and I look forward to each game with enthusiasm.” He said he would be happier if Bakgaga could finish the season in the top eight.He added: “Last season Baroka had to fight in the play-offs to keep their top flight status and we told ourselves we do not want that to happen again this season. “Our aim is to finish in the top eight. If we can get six or seven points in our remaining games, then I am certain we will be in the top eight.” Motupa did not want to comment on his future, as he still has a contract with Pirates until 2020.“My focus is on Baroka and on doing well here,” he said. “Baroka have been good to me and I am fully focused. I am happy here – let’s wait and see what will happen at the end of the season. “The only thing I am thinking of now is helping Baroka finish in the top eight and getting more goals for them.” Motupa said they were bracing themselves for a tough match against Fadlu Davids’ Maritzburg side: “I believe the team that wants it more will win it. I hope it will be us. We cannot afford to disappoint our fans at home again after the 2-1 defeat to Sundowns.” Baroka were in eighth place with 33 points yesterday, but that will have changed if Bidvest Wits beat Ajax Cape Town at Athlone Stadium last night.
