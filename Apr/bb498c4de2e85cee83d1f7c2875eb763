IT IS that time of the season again – it’s squeaky bum time! The Absa Premiership title run-in is fast turning into a tense two-horse race between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, who are neck-and-neck at the top.This pits Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane against his Pirates counterpart, Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvvqcj_mK--rmAIQ0PJbGeWOJGrlC7-iLtaW5q9OZYVTF5iZiw3BDVUAYZRZTwMHH5jVaHQMfvJi8cRAoiGEQ9lzeIAxVRxt3nibrh6ylPGrg8x9D91kwoQ8eh5Ws_jWdCBbBzmjQEmEl4CpNtCa_9R3cZxYIRrXcPYSOqx_jrJhfyeK8CAjlbcY5IrYVXmduo93QUFfTlRlm0U8l9_b3kphlDKR-A3wDPur9uwhmcvFNEf7HGNXMhPA7gyYlK0PjJeVEHXv5XZ6jlSXN6TmNNCoRI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB1tAkcU_FVnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Micho’s charges are snapping at Downs’ heels just a point behind, having dodged a banana peel when they edged Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 at Orlando Stadium midweek.Lurking in third place are Kaizer Chiefs with 39 points, who are keeping a close eye on the situation, hoping to capitalise on possible slip-ups.But on current form, it’s unlikely the two frontrunners will drop points as they eye the big R10 million winners’ prize.“What are you going to do with good football with five matches left,” asked Mosimane. “Play good football at the beginning and show off. But now it’s tough. “You must take three points home. You could see it wasn’t the Sundowns that we like against Chippa. It’s squeaky bum time. It’s all about regeneration. We need more legs and for other players to come to the party.” “Baroka are cocky. They are free-spirited,” Mosimane said.Sredojevic, meanwhile, continues to play mind games, stressing the importance of qualifying for the Caf Champions League instead of worrying about the title race.“Before we think about Sundowns we need to improve our football and collect points. This is the only focus we have at present. We know the league title is not our hunt, our hunt to reach our destiny is the five matches we need to play. We will approach each match like a cup final and we’ll see what it brings us in the end.”He went on: “I am happy that we are there, in a place leading us to Africa, because so many people on the continent miss Orlando Pirates!“We will do everything possible to reach that goal. But currently we are only looking at the test in front of us, which is our game against SuperSport next week.” Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka said: “It’s possible that the two frontrunners drop points. We need to run our own race and win our remaining games, then it might be a different story come end of the season.”
