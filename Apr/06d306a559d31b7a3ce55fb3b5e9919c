SPECULATION of Andile Jali joining Mamelodi Sundowns was strengthened by KV Oostende confirming on Friday that they have parted ways with the midfielder. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane confirmed that they’re in discussions with Jali, who left the Belgium club by mutual consent. But he explained Downs were not negotiating aggressively, as the ball rested more in Jali’s court. Jali is expected back in Mzansi today. Affordability is also another factor for the club, as Jali is not returning home for much less than his current financial package at Oostende. Sundowns aren’t the only club eyeing the 28-year-old Jali, as former club, Orlando Pirates, and Kaizer Chiefs have set their gaze on the influential Bafana Bafana midfielder. “We’re talking to his agent. Andile is an important player. But can we afford him?” asked Mosimane. “There’s no pressure. Keke (Hlompho Kekana) is there, Mabunda Tiyani is there, there’s also Oupa (Manyisa) and Soumahoro Bangaly can play six too. “But a right Andile would push to be in the starting line-up. The quality is there. He’s got the right match attitude. But it also depends on the finances.” Jali’s agent, Mike Makaab, said his client would only settle for a good offer, emphasising they could still consider good offers from European clubs. Jali was recently quoted as saying he’d made up his mind about coming home as he wanted to be close to his family. Meanwhile, Mosimane has also admitted they may not be able to hold on to key defender, Anele Ngcongca, who could return to Belgium. Ngcongca has attracted interest from Cercle Brugge and he could well be in his last few weeks with the Brazilians. But Mosimane wouldn’t be happy to see him go. He said: “It’s up to him. But we wouldn’t want to him to go now. He’s finding his feet. “If he wants to leave he has to speak to us and get a transfer. Anele is experienced, he’s clever and whenever he plays, he doesn’t disappoint. He’s played Champions League matches against Chelsea.”
