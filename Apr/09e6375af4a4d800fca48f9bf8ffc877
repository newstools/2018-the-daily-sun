HARARE, ZIMBABWE - A prophet (27) has appeared in court after allegedly killing one of his congregants. The incident happened last weekend during a baptism session at Nyaure River in Domboshawa. According to New Zimbabwe.com, pastor Masimba Chirayi mistook Wendy Masuka for a “vampire”. He told the Harare Magistrates Court he didn’t kill Masuka on purpose. “In my eyes she was like a vampire possessed by demons,” said Chirayi. He was released on a $50 (R600) bail. – NEWS24
