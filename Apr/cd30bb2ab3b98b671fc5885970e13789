Former Mzansi president Jacob Zuma will be taking wife number seven. His new bride is 24-year-old Nonkanyiso Conco. Conco confirmed to the Sowetan that she and the elder statesman were set to wed. “Yes‚ we are getting married‚ but that is all I can say. I need to consult before I give any interviews‚” she told the publication. The publication said Conco is a director of the Pietermaritzburg-based Nomkhubulwane Culture and Youth Development Organisation‚ aimed at protecting the cultural practices of Zulu maidens. The Citizen reports that Zuma and his family have apparently already paid lobola for her, and both families are understood to be happy with the union. Zuma celebrated his 76th both day earlier this month.
