When members of the Ntsholo family visit the local clinic, they are treated like regular restaurant customers. They’ve been in and out of the clinic so many times nurses even know them by name. That’s because they live near a dirty canal at Nkanini squatter camp in Lwandle in Strand, near Cape Town. Sizeka Ntsholo (40) said people’s dirty water spills out into the canal while some dump rubbish here. She said when it’s raining, the water flows into their shack. “We have sores and have lost count of the number of times we’ve visited the clinic for treatment.” Sizeka said her six-year-old son suffered the most. She tried to build a wall sometime last year, but that didn’t keep the water away. Anda Ntsodo, mayoral committee member for Area East, said certain areas near the canal were not easily accessible. “The solid waste management department removes visible waste on the banks of the canal. “The team assists the transport and urban development authority to clean up the waste. “Residents are asked to stop dumping waste in the canal and use blue bags and wheelie bins.”
