SUPERSPORT United and Bidvest Wits have both failed to secure a spot in the CAF Confederation Cup group stages. United were eliminated by Kenyan side Gor Mahia despite claiming a 2-1 win in the second leg on Wednesday evening at Lucas Moripe Stadium. Mahia advanced to the group stages on away goals rule following a 2-2 aggregate. The Kenyans headed into the second leg with an advantage, having won the first leg 1-0 over two weeks ago in Kenya. Wits who have been slammed for not taking the continental competitions serious in the past few seasons did not make any difference again this year as they also failed to make it to the next round of the tournament after playing to a goalless draw with Nigerian side, Enyimba in the second leg of their play-off tie. Enyimba headed into the clash with a slight advantage after registering a 1-1 draw in the first leg in South Africa, and the goalles in Nigeria ensured that the host are through to the group stages.
