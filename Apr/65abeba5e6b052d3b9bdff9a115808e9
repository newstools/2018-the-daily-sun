You are far more than that. Nothing is really ever that hard. Because we are born with the strength, it just takes a lifetime and hardships to find it. I promise you it’s in there. Find it,” she continued.She also encouraged anyone who is considering taking their own lives to find hope in that people like her are availing themselves to be your comfort.The singer said that there is beauty in the world, and we should all remember to find it within ourselves and in the universe whenever we feel alone and sad.“You deserve all the kindness. Not just from anyone else, but from yourself. You deserve patience from yourself,” she said.“You don’t have to accept all the things you can’t change, but you do have to understand them and find your place within them or you might find that you don’t fit in there,” she ended the thread.You are not what they said you are.
