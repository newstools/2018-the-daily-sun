THERE may be six rounds of matches left, but the next four could determine the destiny of the Absa Premiership title. Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane reckons four successive wins could do the trick and secure top honours for his team – or at least edge them much closer to the lucrative R10 million cheque!Fresh from their 2-1 Nedbank Cup quarterfinal victory over Cape Town City, the Brazilians shift their focus back to the league, hungry for more wins.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstrmBHdEzb-eRbvfn6D_0OR9fVQE7tNbam9nOPTJAmAkISjMWVlH1F__VTe-0kXYUUhkQ69dB7njRMBR9bN66GsjAl9WhZXRAx9U4Nh5uXiQDoVdj_cKQGM8QBOBl2pQkcwzQOlBEfhmx5QFHu6MeMVGpQa_lbTelX_P0gkmGiiYfhF10ycYHZjcI44Pu6GJv4k_SDNkzEDdJUdFOmdBKpb_nlCjjcu4YRVq3G9TiiDuHWwz-nWq_xdInDhn34W9385uoeUMc2eRj9VM5aRG-RTw-E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzENjxfeqWp4QEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

For months, everyone expected Sundowns to run away with the title, with many even predicting an early crowning for them. But that was before Orlando Pirates quietly crept up from mid-table obscurity to position themselves as fellow title contenders.Surprise draws against Free State Stars and SuperSport United also forced a slight reassessment on Sundowns’ side, as pressure is also mounting in other competitions, such as the Caf Champions League.So the Brazilians’ nerves might be jangling as they return to the league front leading Bucs by just a point, albeit with a game in hand.Sundowns, on 43 points, need to win to put some distance between them and Pirates, who are breathing down their necks.There is also pressure on Jeremy Brockie to start firing, although Mosimane has denied that the Kiwi was under scrutiny.“Let’s win four and see what happens. Four matches,” said the coach.“We want to be in control of our destiny. But talk is cheap. We have to go out on the pitch and do it.”On Brockie, Mosimane said: “We won the Champions League and the league without Brockie. He is not the saviour. We don’t expect Brockie to help us. He found us at the top of the standings. “He is an important member of the team because I feel we sometimes have more football-playing members than finishers. He is meant for that. At the moment he is still adjusting. Sundowns are a difficult team to play for. Aubrey Ngoma is adjusting . . . George Lebese is adjusting. It took Tiyani Mabunda longer to play.”With a sizable 13-point gap between Sundowns and Chippa, coach Vladislav Heric faces his own pressure, being outside the top eight.Ninth with 30 points, Chippa are only a loss away from the relegation zone. But Heric had a positive start to his second spell there, with a revenge win against Free State Stars.
