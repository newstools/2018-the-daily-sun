THE family of
Michael Komape has lost its claim for general and constitutional damages for
the death of their son, who drowned in a pit latrine in 2014. The Limpopo
High Court in Polokwane dismissed the claim on Monday. Judge Gerrit
Muller ordered that two of Komape's siblings be paid R6 000 each for general
medical expenses. The five-year-old
drowned in a pit toilet at Mahlodumela Primary School, outside Polokwane, four years ago. Meanwhile, Section 27 says it notes with mixed reaction the
judgment handed down in the trial of the tragic death of Michael Komape by
Judge Muller. "While we welcome the structural interdict to provide
adequate and safe sanitation for learners in the Limpopo Province, we are at
the same time extremely disappointed that the suffering of the Komape family
and the circumstances of Michael â€˜s death has been insufficiently recognised
and acknowledged." Section 27 said it is of the view that this is a missed
opportunity for developing the law in respect of constitutional damages. The failure to award damages in this case stands in contrast to
the damages that were awarded by the retired Deputy Chief Justice Mosenke to
the families of the Life Esidimeni victims for the callous treatment of the
victims in that case. The organisation says it is still studying the judgment but they
have taken further instructions from the Komape family in respect of this. "We anticipate that we
will be appealing the damages aspect of the judgment in the Supreme Court of
Appeal," Section 27 said.
