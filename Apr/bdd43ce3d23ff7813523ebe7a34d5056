EVERY week, Friday descends on Maureen Mtshali’s home like a black cloud. She is haunted by her memories of screaming and pleading.  THIS IS BECAUSE HER SON WAS KIDNAPPED AND BURNED TO DEATH ON A FRIDAY IN FEBRUARY AFTER HE WAS ACCUSED OF STEALING. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstO16VGxjQn4rY8pN2X-NzhLTPEVGaH4MBBwKntrWSXJtWEDfUTdGXGiPxltGzEXW_1vhE7KvL01qcVsUFtKDzDCpjRdmZITlAIRqiltS9JOcKIyoun74acm-wyoSDK4aWBHDBK8UfKkk1YUcW8DwhL8aBKeA561Cas4P02k4SuxX4NRMcWUQHiVuG5Ge-UZJNCWU9WCfd21UZFG9pCICSS7Z2moRobQRgrwy3P_pj7p_FWErPyFt-qPXkelv2k6Id794A5wcE3wcHY4Bt5-BeL-UZ0zgJj\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP1D4sFskY2IEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s black Friday for us every week,” she said.She told the SunTeam the men arrived at her house on 2 February and said Mxolisi had stolen a small television set. She said he screamed and kicked to free himself from his kidnappers but he was overpowered. He was later found near a mealie field. Petrol had been poured over him and he had been set alight. He died in hospital two days later. Maureen said she moved an orange couch Mxolisi had in his outside room into the main house and she sometimes slept on it to feel close to him. “When I sleep on it, I forget the sad memories but it’s very hard to overcome what happened.” Mxoli’s gogo Lizzy (65) said she had to take sleeping tablets so she wasn’t haunted by his screams. “My grandson died a brutal death over something he didn’t do. “Those men definitely kidnapped the wrong person.” “His uncle tried to intervene but they pointed a gun at him and he had to hide.”She said the men bundled Mxolisi into a van, took him to a field and burned him. Although he died at Far East Hospital in Springs two days later, he was able to tell his family who had kidnapped him. “We recorded him as he told us the names of the men. He said after he was burned, he managed to put out the flames and limped to the main road to get help from passing motorists,” said Maureen.“He sustained burns all over his body and the doctors told us he was not going to survive for long. “It was the video recording that helped the cops bust two suspects.” Maureen said she was disappointed to learn that one of the suspects was a neighbour. “Mxolisi was a focused person and had dreams. He had applied for a job at a mine in Rustenburg and was supposed to start last month. We only found out he had been hired after he was already dead,” she said. “I think the kidnappers used the television as an excuse and there was something else going on. Mxolisi told us seven men tortured him but only two were arrested.” Police Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe confirmed that a case of murder was opened and said two suspects were released on bail. They will be back in court next month.
