We still do not have answers. “The circumstances of my cousin’s death are suspicious. We want answers from the government.”Tapiwa, who had been living in South Africa for the past six year, groomed horses in Klapmuts, in the Cape Winelands. He was supposed to receive treatment for schizophrenia.Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects a person’s grip on reality. It is characterised by hallucinations, delusions and reduced feelings of pleasure in everyday lifeEmily Chirwa, one of Tapiwa’s close friends, said: “It seems like he walked to his death when he went to the hospital. “He was supposed to go home but his family had him admitted because they wanted to stabilise him for the journey.”Some of Tapiwa’s friends said he also developed an eating disorder last year.“We all hoped he was going to be okay. He seemed to get better when he was admitted to the hospital. “He was also going to receive treatment when he got to Zimbabwe.“All the family took home with them was his corpse,” added Chirwa.Tapiwa was buried in Zimbabwe last week. He had one child and was also looking after his late brother’s children in Zimbabwe.His countrymen in Stellenbosch want the department of health to take responsibility for his death. Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a murder case had been opened.She said: “The body of a 41-year-old male was found in a hospital ward. It is suspected that he was strangled. No one has been arrested.”Cape Winelands Health spokeswoman Megan Sonnenberg said: “The case has been referred to forensic services for an autopsy to determine the cause of death.”
