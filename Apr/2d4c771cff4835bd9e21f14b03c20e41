WHEN this primary school teacher saw the living conditions of neglected kids and orphans in her small home town, she was moved. Elna Mong (57) from Smithfield in the Northern Cape’s Xhariep district made a vow to start a children’s home. In 2016, Tsekiso’s Foster House for Child and Youth Cluster opened its doors to poor kids.  The orphanage and care centre is a registered non-profit organisation taking care of nearly 50 orphans and neglected kids.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssFGreLTE05Xd-swTIgN6o4n6Wcb8Jy4MPggwem6s-acKL_P1B8QQH9RE-BwFOZ0pg7mxiUnxrqSUnE7si0w9ak-BICNLXxo7_15DnSio6zka3Hs4PCSa_nYLbzD52nwvCFi9gzema9aeY-bLgJIT80Wf4Rjra5eAJy9_bla40jxSFT5RUwc4t0iDsQQmora9_2UsZ4AKUL3orw26VzQ64oqSQG4CjxmM5znGIwHmoebNYkPWBiL1K_xvENT48cqT2qljxWS0IezmfQpqCDYdPxkI75n0A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMTL9VUcDiiBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
