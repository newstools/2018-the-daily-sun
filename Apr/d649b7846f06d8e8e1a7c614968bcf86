I’m getting paid as an athlete now, I sell clothes, I’ve got a construction company. I’ve got a lot of ideas that I won’t mention here cause broers copy my moves but I’ve been given an amazing mind and I plan to use it”, he added.The Baby Girl hit-maker owns everything he has, which includes two Bentleys worth at least R3.7 – million each and a mansion that is definitely worth more.“I’m 27 bro and everything real on this side bro. Nothing rented or fake. I am truly living out my dreams,” he told another follower.The rapper truly is living out his dreams as he recently ticked off another goal on his list when he completed a marathon.In collaboration with Nike, Cassper took part in the Berlin Half Marathon which he completed in less than two hours.Leaving the crib for Berlin for a big one!!!
