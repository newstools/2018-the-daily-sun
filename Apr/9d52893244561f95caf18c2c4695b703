FURIOUS residents barricaded roads with burning tyres, rocks and old iron yesterday morning, demanding service delivery and electricity. The people from the Caleb Motshabi, Ipopeng and Phelindaba kasis in Mangaung said they were angry that while they couldn’t even be sure their refuse would be collected every week, almost R20 million was spent on a welcoming party for new Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela last week. Police vehicles were sent to the scene to monitor the situation but the protesters were calm and there was no violence. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsttIuEgF7ssjwa1DjwBibwrR5WFUEjBJHbQqhViOl08XiL9R491HkCOXAL6GV0sXxc3NrgqbAin_u7AcDf4OCttwuF2ALacQuNBeT_h6SQA8A5z_HEHz5xn8frKTGQsARp620uA6s-p1G1i8vzPT-58xQfYVL5uzCCtci17BmDdnDSpEBT-dP8f6296x7PcXMqJfNMAS7DRzLD2WFhM6qBK_gECcHcM4BZYRZytiU72UCO526-51MyC7hO0E5lC01nMp9-rWjx2fRxP-Xq9BgVZpsQUlCg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOfTXqcTxM8PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
