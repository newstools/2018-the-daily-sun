IN a empty venue where there was just shout of players and their coaches from the sidelines, Orlando Pirates kept their title hopes alive with a 4-0 thrashing of Bidvest Wits at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday night. The fixture played behind closed doors as a result of the one-match sentence  (with one more suspended for 24 months) for Pirates pitch invasion at Loftus Versfeld when they lost 6-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns early last year. The victory for Pirates saw them returning to the Caf Champions League as they now have 52 points which third placed Maritzburg United who have 43 would not reach in their remaining two league fixtures. Sifiso Hlanti's own goal in the 13th minute, Augustine Mulenga's brace 38th-minute and 58th , and Justin Shonga's 41st-minute goal from the spot kick ensured that the Buccanners secure maximum points. Pirates came into the encounter knowing that a defeat or draw will hand Sundowns the league title. They had hope that on form Maritzburg will do them a big favor by beating the Brazilians again at Harry Gwala at the same time. But Downs were held to a 2-2 draw which means they will now need to beat Ajax Cape Town at Loftus Stadium on Saturday (3pm) to lift the title, while Pirates must overcome Cape Town City at Athlone hoping the Thwane side slip-up to take the race down to the wire.
