Kuben Naidoo.The Reserve Bank placed VBS under curatorship in early March
because of the bank’s severe liquidity crisis. Vele Investments wanted to
challenge the placing of the bank under curatorship in court as
"unconstitutional", but dropped the case in mid-March on the advice
of its board.At the time the investment group said it would work
alongside the SARB and other stakeholders such as Treasury and the Public
Investment Corporation to support the curatorship.SizweNtsalubaGobodo started its duties as curators on Monday
March 12, led by director Anoosh Rooplal. Naidoo and other representatives from
the SARB met with the Rooplal’s team on March 22 for an update on the curator's
initial findings.In SARB's affidavit published on Tuesday, Naidoo said when
Rooplal commenced its curatorship duties, VBS had a cash liquid position of
over R24m and “ostensibly” held deposits amounting to R2.9bn.Naidoo said the figure of corporate deposits of R900m is yet
to be confirmed.“It is uncertain as to whether these corporate deposits
represent ‘true’ deposits and Mr Rooplal has to date been unable to confirm the
amounts in respect of all these deposits were actually received by VBS Mutual
Bank,” Naidoo said in the affidavit.The findings by the curator also show that VBS was paying
brokerage commissions to entities to attract deposits, mainly from
municipalities.“This is highly unusual for banks,” Naidoo said.“The liquid cash position would not enable VBS Mutual Bank
to repay deposits as and when required.”SOURCE: NEWS24
