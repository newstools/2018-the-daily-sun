ABOUT 150 students marched to parliament yesterday to deliver a memorandum of demands. The memorandum was directed to the minister of higher education, the minister of justice and all public universities. It demanded that all cases against students relating to #FeesMustFall be dropped. Organiser Athabile Nonxuba, who has a number of pending cases against him, said he was set to appear in court on the 11 May.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss2SVgvdl5G5L7lssAyTXpE0qsjDJm3FAa2V1zGv0IjT7m-UXXLl4BfaSqumiOdFb6kGxr6YAjW07-CIfizkse2R-i_I5cjlbwpKHXY_OUy0wj5KJQ8lISKA34YjOJkV8buS00F8Xi_BpCrRHlq9Yj2JgMmO5gtQp-5n_Kosd7TVX4RsSdPHp5Ohd_MBw-5lW_FPkZDQdfjMGOwfpvBo7bHnFfGyMeWhFeS_phlk7qK-SRQE05fAh3Ox5CnYBYsZCfBnfMO-T7cndl6vQEjmoNfiASsNB0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNVkftRpJknPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I also have cases internally at the University of Cape Town,” he said. “We were not engaged in criminal acts but in political acts that can be justified politically. If land theft was forgiven in this country why can they not forgive students in the same spirit?” Sivuyile Mandoyi said he had been going to court for the same case since 2016. “I sometimes miss classes as I have to appear in court. Failure to appear could lead to me being arrested,” he said. One student was sentenced to eight years in prison with three years suspended on charges of arson, public violence and malicious damage to state property. Other students were expelled from university for their involvement in the protests.Their memorandum was accepted by parliamentary staff as none of the ministers were present. Students at universities in other provinces are also expected to start marching for charges to be dropped against them.
