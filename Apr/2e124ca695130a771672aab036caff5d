A BOY was left traumatised last week when he was allegedly sexually abused by older girls at his primary school. To make matters worse, when the aunt of the nine-year-old from the Free State, tried to open a case against the girls on Friday, the cops said there was nothing they could do. The grade 4 pupil’s aunt (33) said he was afraid to go to school and refused to even play with his friends outside. The incident apparently took place in a classroom. The aunt said: “Last Thursday he refused to go to school, saying he was being bullied. “I was told one of the three girls removed his pants and they took turns abusing him until other pupils intervened and pulled one of the girls off him. “The principal advised us to report the matter to Selosesha cop shop but the police said they couldn’t do anything.” She said the SGB sent an apology letter to the family and a meeting with the girls’ parents has been arranged. Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma told Daily Sun: “The victim’s aunt was told that according to the Child Justice Act, children under 12 cannot be criminally charged.” Free State Education department spokesman Howard Ndaba said they were aware of the allegations and the girls were suspended until a disciplinary hearing was undertaken. Counselling has been arranged for the boy.
