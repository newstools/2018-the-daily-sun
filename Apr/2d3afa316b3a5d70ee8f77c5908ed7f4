MAYOR Patricia de Lille this week visited one of 22 job centres that train job seekers and connect them with bosses. T he centres have placed 29 youths in the workplace so far! “In Atlantis I met participant Chuma Jaqu, who found a job through the programme,” said De Lille. Chuma (25), from Gugulethu, matriculated in 2014 but struggled for two years to get a job. He volunteered at a hospital after doing a paramedics course. In February, he got a job as a general assistant at Cashbuild in Gugulethu and was promoted to cashier. Cape Town’s unemployment rate, at 21,7%, is better than that of other cities but still high. “We can’t redress the inequalities of our apartheid past if the formal economy remains elusive,” said De Lille. “Government must work with business and all of society to ensure job seekers, especially the youth, access the economy. “Speaking to job seekers, I was inspired by their hope for the future.” The City embarked on the three-year programme, its first, in December. It’s run by Lulaway, which identifies, prepares and places job seekers. Since earlier this year, the programme has trained 295 people in logistics, sales and marketing, call centre and retail.
