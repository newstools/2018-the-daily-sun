Thembelani said his cousin vanished without a trace on Thursday 15 March.“The friend said he never arrived at his place.“Ever since that day, his phone goes straight to voicemail. We strongly believe that he was kidnapped and probably killed.”Thembelani added that his cousin had no known enemies but the family can’t rule out the possibility that his disappearance is politically related.“There’s a high number of political murders in the province.“Only two things make sense here. He could have been kidnapped and killed for political reasons or he was probably killed by someone who wanted to rob him. Everybody knew that he was a teacher and he had just been paid,” said Thembelani.“We beg his killers to give up his body so that we can bury him with dignity.”KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a missing person’s case is being investigated. She urged anyone with information to contact Ndumo police on 033 591 001 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.North region ANC chairman, Berthwell Mthethwa, dismissed suggestions that Xolani’s disappearance could be linked to political murders.“We don’t have political squabbles in our region. “We heard about his disappearance from other comrades. Nobody formally informed us,” said Mthethwa.
