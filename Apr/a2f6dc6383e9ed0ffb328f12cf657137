He had been in power for 37 years.The independent Daily News reported last week that "sulking" Mugabe and his wife Grace "are refusing to remove their property, including furniture and other valuables, from State House."That's despite the fact that the former first family actually hadn't lived in Zimbabwe House since they moved permanently to their private Blue Roof residence in northern Harare 12 years ago.Â The State House building that Zimbabweans see on TV is the place for formal receptions - but the presidential living quarters are understood to be in Zimbabwe House.https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/sulking-mugabe-and-wife-grace-refuse-to-vacate-state-house-reports-20180409
