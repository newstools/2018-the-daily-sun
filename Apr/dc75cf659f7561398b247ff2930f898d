WORLD renowned knitwear designer Laduma Ngxokolo who owns a fashion brand Maxhosa,  has decided to take legal action against international fashion brand, Zara. This is after he was alerted about their socks that sported a similar pattern to  his Khanyisa Cardigan which was launch in March 2014 at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Joburg. Zara is owned by Inditex group which was founded by  Spanish business tycoon Amancio Ortega. In a statement the Port Elizabeth businessman who has dressed the likes of international stars Beyonce, Alicia Keys and Black Coffee said they consulted with Shane Moore and Muhammad Patel from Moore Attorneys, one of Africa’s leading IP law firms who are handling the matter on our behalf. "They have since sent a letter to the parent company alerting them of the copyright infringement and our demands. We have taken such steps so as to avoid our works being appropriated and adapted without our consent or permission. " "Copyright infringement is a matter that we take seriously and fully aware of our intellectual property rights. We would like to thank the clients who have silently sent us proof of such infringements as they see they allowed us means to act. The debate as to whether we shall win the case or not remains, we stand by our decision to fight such a case. Thus, we have sent our letter of demand and we await their reply.
