Whenever we go out she never leaves her camera behind.“Going to mama Winnie’s house was a moment she would never want to miss out on,” said Khulile.He added that he and his wife were home-schooling their children. “Taking her to witness a struggle icon’s remembrance will form part of our history curriculum and this will an event she will never forget because she was there to capture it herself.”Khulile said she takes all the snaps, they go home and review all her work, from the greatest to the worst snaps.“The more photos she takes, the better she becomes. I encourage her and her younger sister to become the best they can be.“I believe our method of teaching works very well for all of us.”Khulile told Daily Sun  they sent Ayakha to creche but quickly took her out because she seemed to be unlearning all the things they had taught her.“We made a decision to home school our daughters because private schools are very expensive. “We did all the relevant research and inquired about it from the department of education.”
