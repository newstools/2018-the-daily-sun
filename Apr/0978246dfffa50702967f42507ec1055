MARITZBURG United coach Fadlu Davids, touted as the best candidate for this year’s PSL Coach of the Season award, has set his sights on a top three finish at the end of the 2017-18 Absa Premiership season.But Davids and midfielder Lebohang Maboe are applying a more cautious approach ahead of tonight’s Absa Premiership showdown with reigning champions Bidvest Wits at the Bidvest Stadium (7.30pm). In fact, the Team of Choice have many reasons to tread carefully as they face momentous challenges ahead, with Wits up tonight, Cape Town City at home on Saturday, Baroka FC in Limpopo on 15 April and a Nedbank Cup semifinal date with Mamelodi Sundowns at Harry Gwala Stadium on 20 April.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvp12OrNqMrCesdDCfrCSlVb9IPfoOxhm7lDz49gfH7Gd-AaZ9xBeGMCuKwv5VMHoTf5b-_3R_oIH7mB8_NmZv2bY_M5fpsAD3a034wBXohE0Xs_WbLt0qPuNINCLr-nPqY60U196_FsZEBWwKk2N7W57mWu_FYk4EZP6TKbyAgQt-QMlG5KI_lE7i0EPhikvP31hCDM1hE3ZrvYb--K9ecGD9galpU8HsjQwZZzcO_SMgigdqeQocDkE8K-kyrWz9ZXQKxxAIwR0IcMO5L-fdx6Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAP73HFCXykFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

For me they are the most experienced side in the league and they deserve every ounce of respect. “Their turnaround in the second half of the league has shown how much they need to be respected. But we have to come back with a respectable result.” Maboe, who walked away with the Man of the Match award against Celtic, agrees with his coach about their next opponents.“The important thing for us right now is to make sure we stay humble and take each game as it comes,” said Maboe.“The Wits match will not be an easy one. We respect them as champions but we want those points – and we will fight for them.”Maboe also praised his midfield partner Siphesihle Ndlovu for his performance in his maiden season. He said he would definitely vote for the 21-year-old for Players’ Player of the Season.“He deserves it,” he added. “Not just that, also the Player of the Season award. He has done well for the team and I will vote for him to help make sure he wins the Players’ Player of the Season award.”Ndlovu has been instrumental to the Team of Choice’s success this season, having picked up a number of Man of the Match awards. He was recently rewarded with a Bafana Bafana call-up and also played an important role in making sure they won the Four Nations tournament concluded in Zambia last week.
