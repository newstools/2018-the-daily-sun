I practised them from a tender age which is why they are perfect,” she said.Esther began painting and doing beadwork at the age of 10.She was taught by her mother and grandmother in the Ndebele tradition.Over the past three decades, Esther has exhibited mural and canvas paintings throughout Europe, Asia, North and South America.
