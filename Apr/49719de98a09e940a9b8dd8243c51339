Trade union Solidarity announced on Thursday that it intends
to apply to the High Court to have embattled state-owned airline South African
Airways (SAA) placed in business rescue.The union intends to bring such an application by 15 May and
has the financial backing for the process, Werner Human, the deputy chief
operating officer: legal services, told Fin24.He explained that SAA is technically insolvent and the union
qualifies as an "affected person" who can bring a business rescue
application in terms of the Companies Act.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsso5AA5ybiYRm1MC56hhXIxC_2Sub3wyEgdFr0tRiRGu2HFCCizrolw2EsBw3xpCfQcpcvdYnIifwvtvlxYnVvM9q6PSeVstB-xhPS8TOOcZB0CVdZqATn0vsLYP8OAYk7vAMsuUM1ztxUYqYKavIs6vf42lcTAdhrsg0xr5q5oZaLNV2QfPJrMlxGVNhLf1HpBmtpXG0X2_FrdMKQDmGb7bu_Y5GlvPHwrJHfauBR8yHbMap6Jyeov3RDxK9H7ia9VKlK0zA4A9GKqJsvZ_zIn0u8KnY4\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YQybZ-eBx6X_OivJSPq5DjlReihIvgN5nUS9rgvU3VcC2wrguAuZuS09yTXnUkX456O5h9PMpzDC4AqxwDzL6QKSpDTgUyCTrpk0FmATg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIh5rDRnZtVEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

SAA is not a new discussion, but nobody has taken that step yet. We believe we
are in a unique position to take this step, not only on behalf of our members
working at the airline, but in the interest of the SA public at large - especially
taxpayers," said Human.He pointed out that several political parties and civil
organisations have already proposed that SAA be placed under business rescue.
In a recent report to Parliament, even the Auditor General (AG) wanted to know
why this has not yet happened.Solidarity said the AG indicated in a report that SAA had
suffered a total loss of R5.6bn in 2017. The AG also indicated that there was
concern about the SAAâ€™s status as a going concern.The board and management of SAA responded in March to say
they are taking urgent steps to address issues raised by the AG and remain
optimistic about the airline's future.SOURCE: NEWS24
