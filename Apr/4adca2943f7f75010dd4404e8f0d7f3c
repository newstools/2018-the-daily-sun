MONDAY was a big day for Bulelani Mazibuko. Two days ago, the 19-year-old from Emandabeni, in Estcourt, obtained a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy, politics and law. Bulelani, who started going to school when he was five, was the youngest graduate of the University of KZN’s college of humanities. “I am excited and humbled that this moment has finally arrived,” he said. He said his parents sent him to school at a young age because they could tell he was a bright child. Although many of his fellow graduates were looking forward to entering the job market, Bulelani said he was going to keep studying. “I’ve enrolled for a law degree. When I complete the course, I will pursue a post- graduate qualification in the field. I am in no rush to work,” he said. Bulelani said a person’s background does not determine their future. “Despite the fact that we live in a rural area, my father is an engineer.” He advised students to have a purpose and do everything possible to make their dreams a reality. “Know your priorities, believe in yourself and work hard.” Bulelani’s older sister Nonkululeko (23) said her brother’s relatives and friends were proud of his achievement. She said: “The family is thankful to him for working so hard. But above all, we thank God for guiding and protecting him.”
