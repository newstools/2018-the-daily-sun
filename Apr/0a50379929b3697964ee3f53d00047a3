THE Gauteng Department of Health has issued 133 licences of
compliance to mental health NGO's in the province.In order for the NGOs to be issued with the licences, they have to
comply with the requirements of safe patient care and sound financial
management.Acting Head of Department Professor Mkhululi Lukhele said he is quite
happy that the department has undertaken this thorough exercise with strength
to ensure that the licensing process is flawless.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuO4NjPdVt48pycvcWPK3A_cqnLP0vkYSL8krTGe8mXUOHALcHFeCPpoypHUnPXua95XF72jUe1NPlbZog6WaSkr_4IeNldF6Bs8xl3IlKCK5dv4qihrWNU1qSmCPPFDFUErrj6HORbARLw3gsrY9c35roXlKqBemv-My0UZYQmnubZAcFz2YnZb46zJJxuZWwuzgloBQOrbIJj2fb-nfekw3rFu58VuBylj5lALqieaMu0cu2d718kIYh4vs-R2SbDxzSxbiKm5GT9oyPbzNBSw0esQjqk\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YToCaxfL9z87PF8zmFIerAXmE0Tsn8A0KG0VBLvpinZBpfoRII4hCEbf-2aP689kisSGkD3gezkHp0nrTzpC1lx6VVLJTUgCdr_0iUb\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI6dAzrFH_aoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

tragedy, which saw over 140
mentally-ill patients die mostly from dehydration and hunger after the Department
terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni.To date over 40 patients are still unaccounted by the department.In the process of issuing the licences, the department conducted
both announced and unannounced visits to the NGOs in order to monitor the
quality of care given to mental care patients."The Gauteng Department of Health would also like to take
this opportunity to dispel the allegations of delays in the payment of
subsidies. "There is no truth in this, and there are no recorded
incidents, complaints about the delay or non-payment of subsidies to
NGOs," Lukhele said.
