 A total of 14 villages in Tzaneen Limpopo are protesting
over lack of water in the area. The villagers say they have been begging the municipality
to provide them with clean water for many years. Their District Municipality, however, is offering to
supply them water using water tankers and the communities are not happy with
this.  One of the group leaders, Sylvia Nkuna said the
communities are sick and tired about the empty promises by the Mopane District
Municipality which keep promising them that they will get piped water. She said they started engaging the municipality on March
this year and they promised that they will revamp bulk water supply from
Kambako to all villages around N’wamitwa area but they failed. Nkuna said the Municipality opted to supply water to 14 villages
using water tankers  but the community
rejected this. “They told us that by sending two water takers it will
cost the municipality over R20 000 a day, so why can’t they just revamp
boreholes or bulk water supply, ” She said. Another protester, Martha Ngoveni said when the Municipality
revamp boreholes and bulk water supply in the area. Mapone Mayor Nkekareng Rakgoale said he was in a meeting
when approached for comment.
