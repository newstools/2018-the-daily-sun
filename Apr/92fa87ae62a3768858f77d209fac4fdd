WHEN Mongezi Moni (47) heard people calling his neighbour’s name at about 5am on Saturday, he didn’t know he was making a big mistake by responding. Four men kicked down his door and dragged him out of his shack in KTC squatter camp near Cape Town. “His only sin was to respond,” said his cousin, Zoleka Moni. “They kicked his door down and took him. We heard our cousin begging the men to let him go, but they forced him into a Toyota Quantum. “When we shouted for help, one of the men pointed a gun at us and said if we continued to make a noise, they would kill us,” she said. Mongezi was a mechanic and his body was found dumped in Nyanga. “He was a good person. He never fought with anyone. “Maybe if he had not answered he would still be alive. My cousin was killed for no reason,” said Zoleka. “My other cousin was stabbed to death for nothing in 2016 and his killers were never arrested. He was on his way back home when he was attacked for no reason.” Western Cape police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that a man (47) was stabbed and his body dumped. Anyone with information about the incident should call Nyanga police on 021 380 3300 or on 08600 10111.
