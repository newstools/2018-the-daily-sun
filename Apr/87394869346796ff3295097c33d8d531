THE Free State government has failed Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. That’s the opinion of residents in Majwemasweu in Brandfort, Free State.The house she lived in during her exile years in Brandfort has fallen apart. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Daily Sun has run many stories about promises the local government made to turn it into a museum. About R1,8 million of the R3 million allocated for the project has allegedly been spent.But the only development at the house was the addition of security in January and a fence that was built in December.A group of women dressed in ANC clothing and waiting to hold a prayer meeting told Daily Sun it hurt them that Madikizela-Mandela died before she could cut the ribbon to open the museum.“I knew Winnie personally. She was very kind to us all,” said gogo Marta Nqana (82). Maria Jantjie (64) said: “At first she was not allowed to greet or talk to anyone.“We were afraid to talk to her but she talked to us,”Madikizela-Mandela apparently persuaded them not to cover their waists with blankets. “She opened our eyes. She fed the poor and taught us to share,” said Maria.Daily Sun sent many emails to and phoned Tankiso Zola, Free State arts, culture and recreation spokesman. But he didn’t respond.MEC Mathabo Leeto said: “Are you not tired of writing about that story. Now that Winnie has passed away, you want to write about it again. “This is not our project. It belongs to the national office.”
