Dear MizzB I am a 26-year-old woman who has worked very hard to gain her independence. I recently started a relationship with a great man. He is everything I wanted, but I have a feeling he may not be the one for me. MizzB, how can I tell if he is the right one. - Mbokodo Women complicate things while men can tell from the beginning. Look for three things: shared values, family structure and respect. These are foundations that will carry you through all seasons, high or low. Sharing a lot in common doesn’t guarantee a successful relationship. Ask yourself this: when you are with him, are you comfortable being who you are? If you can’t be who you are with the one you love, it becomes the foundation of a battle ground between dominance and submission.
