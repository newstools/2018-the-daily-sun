I am busy with renovating my restaurant in Soweto at the moment. Kasi Chef  is about getting people from iKasi to come and cook traditional foods. We will have a reality show about that. The nice thing about our reality show is that it goes with incentives, there is monetary value that comes with it, there will be prizes to be won."
