SOMETIMES traffic cops land in such strange situations, they embarrass themselves.On Friday at 10.30am on North Rand Road in Boksburg, two Ehurhuleni Metro cop vans crashed into each other, all because a gogo was driving the wrong way.The two Nissan Hardbodies were tailing each other when the driver in the front realised a car was coming into traffic the wrong way and was heading straight for him.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The cop stopped just in time to avoid a head-on collision with the gogo but apparently, his colleague had his head in the clouds and rear-ended him.There were two cops in both bakkies and all four were sent to Samrand Hospital after sustaining minor injuries.Ekurhuleni Metro cop spokesman Kobedi Mokheseng said the gogo told cops her dog travelling with her distracted her and she ended up losing control.“The driver wasn’t involved in the accident and did not sustain any injuries,” said Mokheseng.Facebook users shared their thoughts on the incident.Stefan Alberts: “Give them credit. Metro cops were on the scene immediately!”Emmett Groenewald: “And here you see EMPD in their natural mating position!”Brendan Bentley: “These officers were doing a crash course in advanced driving.”Sabelo Ntshangase: “Ouch. How is that possible? Were they fighting for the middle lane?”
