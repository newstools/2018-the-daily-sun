“THE police are not a burial society where we just bury each other. The cops must use their weapons to protect themselves from the attacks waged on them by thugs.” These were the words of Police Minister Bheki Cele. He was speaking yesterday at the memorial service for murdered Constable Ncedo Katoyi (39) at Salvation Church of Faith in Khayelitsha. Katoyi was shot dead when he went to attend to a complaint in Site C last week. Cele said he had been in office for just two months, but had already attended three funerals of cops killed by thugs. “Cop killers cannot sleep. When the perpetrator is found, don’t knock. Police must kick down the door. “We are going to deal with cop killers,” Cele said. Station commander Mkhu- seli Kwintshi said he was very shocked to hear of Katoyi’s murder. “Katoyi died with his boots on. He was a hard worker.” Cops laid wreaths at Khayelitsha Police Station, where Katoyi worked. At the church, cops and Katoyi’s widow, Ntombothando, lit candles. Katoyi will be buried in the Eastern Cape over the weekend.
