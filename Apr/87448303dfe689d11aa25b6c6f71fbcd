A lot of women of colour struggle a lot when it comes to choosing the right foundation for make-up.When I started using make up I was excited and didn't know that it would be so hard choosing foundation until I was at a make up stall trying out different foundation but still was not satisfied with how they looked on me. The lady helping me kept on talking about undertones and shade matching which were completely foreign to me. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Foundation is one of those things that before you actually buy you have to test and kind of sleep on it if you can because ones you get it you are stuck with a whole bottle that you don't like. Thankfully, brands have slowly begun to expanding their colour ranges.Here are some important tips you should consider to help you find the perfect foundation match.- Find the right foundation for your skin typeThe first step is finding a product that is right for your individual skin type. A tinted moisturizer doesn’t offer as much coverage as a foundation, but only choose a heavier foundation if your skin truly warrants it. If your skin is oily or the weather near you is particularly hot and humid, an oil-free foundation is your best bet.- Understand your undertoneAs a woman of colour, you’re more likely to be considered as having a warm undertone. Test this out by checking out the inside of your wrists. Do your veins appear blue or green? If green, you're warm-toned. If you have trouble telling, you probably lean neutral. So basically, your foundation should have that yellow or golden tone glow to it.- Choose your formula Base this on your skin type and the coverage and finish you want. The dryer your skin, the richer and more emollient your foundation should be. Oilier skin types should go for oil-free foundations.- Match your shade to your skin toneTry test out at least three foundation colours on your skin, along your jawline, to find the perfect match. Get a sample if you can. Try it out for the whole day and see how your skin reacts to it. Some foundations oxidize throughout the day and check you body's chemistry and how it reacts to your skin. A good trick for finding the right shade of foundation is to match it to your chest—especially if you’re good at protecting your face and neck with SPF. You can also test a color on the back of your hand and then walk outside if you don’t trust the store lighting because it can also be deceiving.- Mix and match coloursSome people have dark pigmentation on some areas of their face so if you’re still struggling to find a shade that best complements your whole face, it’s maybe because some elements of your face are lighter than others. Try using two shades on your face: preferably concealer that’s one shade lighter than your foundation.HERE ARE SOME AFFORDABLEFOUNDATIONS TO TRY OUT AND THEIR PRICESMAYBELLINE FIT ME R99YARDLEY STAYFAST FOUNDATION R99Rimmel Last Finish 25H Foundation R169
