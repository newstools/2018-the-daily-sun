I want to be my own self and just be the best I can be.""I've always prided myself on racing the best," added Le Clos, who tied for silver behind Scotland's Duncan Scott in the 100m freestyle with Australia's Olympic champion Kyle Chalmers."My two best races were the 100m and tonight's relay. I got to race the world's best in 100m free and I didn't win, I was disappointed. But I'm proud to step up against the world's best."With Phelps gone after one last hurrah at the 2016 Rio Games, the stage is set for Le Clos to shine at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, although he faces a serious threat from American Caeleb Dressel."We'll see what happens at the Olympic Games," said Le Clos, whose fingertip defeat of Phelps in the 200m butterfly at the 2012 London Olympics remains one of the sport's greatest upsets."There's a lot of youngsters coming through like Dressel, obviously the Aussies in the freestyle, Duncan Scott, James Guy," he added."They're a lot younger than me now. I feel like I'm one of the older guys already but I'm always ready for a good knock, so I'm excited."Le Clos credited fellow South African Cameron van der Burgh for helping to keep his competitive fires burning after the latter marked his final Commonwealth Games by stunning world record-holder Adam Peaty in the 50m breaststroke."We have to say props after that, I still can't get over it," said Le Clos."He came up against the best breaststroker the world's ever had and beat him - if that's not inspiration I don't know what is." -AFP
