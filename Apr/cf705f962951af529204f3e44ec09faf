HIS parents had been desperate for a child, and so had
tried to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF). But days before they were due to have one of four
fertilized embryos transplanted into the mum, Chinese couple Shen Jie and Liu
Xi died in a car accident.According to The
Guardian, the tragic car accident happened in March 2013 in the Chinese
coastal province of Jiangsu.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstm1EG9hKjJOpHao6oGIM2mkCm8B0WPwo4FX5xit_gG9UEv6JTY84EBiyuAJ46Xibrieg9JnFcEZUhWCXy7I-QQWOagLveVB-Ruc828Fdiv-w_mZgG2Tb5Enf7VlQMULKJiFg-Kimny0Xgk9fLG1sqBePRlCpcecNLPxCZ_S7kQbfGq5IaqhL8jowhmxwJKm9CY8URkIZZlTie3OtaNEX_gs2nhC2bteGVSbL0uo4I0U3kg2hr6g91sw6jQi7k6OOOzbvyLEtB2ZxzSCONP4HuVgnAoqU5WlVAk4Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGnIKaOmzxXdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

parents of the deceased couple for the rights to the four frozen embryos left
by their late children.Finally in January 2017, the parents won the right to the
embryos. They then had to find a surrogate mum in secret to carry their
grandchild. This is because using surrogate mothers is illegal in China.At last, in December last year Tiantian – meaning “sweet”
was born in a hospital in Guangzhou in the south of China.Last month Liu’s mum, Hu Xinxian, told Beijing News: “Tiantian’s eyes look like
my daughter’s but overall, he looks more like his father.”The grandparents are still trying to work out what to
tell Tiantian about his tragic and unusual background as he gets older. For
now, they’ve decided to tell him that his parents are away overseas.“This boy is destined to be sad on his arrival into the
world. Other babies have their fathers and mothers, but he doesn’t. We will
definitely tell him in the future. How can we not?” Shen said.
