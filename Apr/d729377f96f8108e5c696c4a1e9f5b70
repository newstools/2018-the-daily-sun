The under-siege Komphela wasn’t the only target of the spleen vented by fans, infuriated by a shock 3-0 league defeat to Chippa United.Club boss Bobby Motaung, seated in the upper suite, also came in for some criticism, with fans chanting his name at the end of the humiliation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvL9KLLYi2_v8Lork5-XQfadXWLY43SAcGIQZPK_iNG_Yze2PPvSJ-bmmRG4u79pe-BDo7yUhKXnp0K_cDCsuO3YPrPobGayu7C-KhTgdNT9DF4pQ9tWF7Y_0cK_KZz-A8y7Y24DCwMhkBvqVcnpKdOcgam_lsLNmvCzsGynx3vocbj_uUlBoFS08PzPHuNEGoAcKSHfnE9fJV_8b2xZvf_4QAchl9NtY407IBipE9C2KVsgFAH9TVWfIXAoZ5q_Mr8KCal6_iVjGZpx3fYE_3gTQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHEaRhpBBBzXEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The midfielder came on for the injured Ramahlwe Mphahlele.Players never really recover from such humiliation.Just as the home side looked like staging a comeback, Machupu beat an offside trap, and Khune for Chippa’s second goal.And there was no one better to seal the sweet victory for Chippa other than Chiefs former striker Edward Manqele.
