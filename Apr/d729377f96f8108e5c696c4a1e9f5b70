The midfielder came on for the injured Ramahlwe Mphahlele.Players never really recover from such humiliation.Just as the home side looked like staging a comeback, Machupu beat an offside trap, and Khune for Chippa’s second goal.And there was no one better to seal the sweet victory for Chippa other than Chiefs former striker Edward Manqele.
