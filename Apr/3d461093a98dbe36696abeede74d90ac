In 2014, she was given a happy letter and a house in Devland across the road from her shack.But after her death in 2016, Karabo said officials said the house didn’t belong to her.They went to the housing department in Soweto, where they were told their mum’s house was in Lakeside instead of Devland. “But Lakeside is in Vereeniging, over 40km away from where she lived for years,” he said.At Human Settlements in Joburg, they were told officials failed to confirmthe house was occupied by the rightful beneficiary. “The subsidy was cancelled and we need to reapply for a house.” The housing department told Daily Sun the gogo’s house was allocated in Lakeside and they haven’t asked the beneficiaries to reapply, but to register.Spokesman Keith Khoza said: “People with title deeds and happy letters weren’t allocated houses because their houses were invaded. Officials asked people with title deeds and letters to register but none did. Instead, people who invaded houses came forward and demanded to be made regular. “The department is starting a registration process to check on mis-allocated beneficiaries.”Khoza said these people are urged to register their names at 37 Pixley Seme Street, Joburg.
