THE gaping pothole on the provincial R55 road in Laudium, Tshwane, will burn a huge hole in the Gauteng government’s pockets.

 Large parts of the road caved in at the weekend. 

 Premier David Makhura said yesterday the bill to fix the tarred road will come in at a whopping R46 million.

 He visited the sinkhole yesterday, accompanied by Transport MEC Ismail Vadi and Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga.

 The premier said 25% of the land in the province was prone to sinkholes.

 The R55 northbound is closed, and motorists are advised to use other routes. 

 He said it was expensive to repair sinkholes.

 “But the government had to respond, regardless, to a crisis of this nature, and whether or not it was budgeted for. 

 “The R55 is a very busy road, and if closed it will cause big problems for communities here. 

 “Fortunately, the other side of the road is not affected.”

 Authorities expect the road to completely cave in. 

 “He said as soon as the sinkhole had matured, steps to repair the road would begin.

 “We have to wait and monitor it closely before we can start repairs. 

 “Our engineers will monitor nearby areas to see if the sinkhole won’t spread.” 

 Vadi said sinkholes take a long time to repair.

 “This will be done by the provincial department of roads and transport. 

 “Once we’ve completed all the technical studies, we’ll see what expertise will be brought in.”

 Msimanga said eight sinkholes were identified in Tshwane and they were fixing three. 
 “The eight identified sinkholes will cost government at least R10 billion in total to fix,” he said.
