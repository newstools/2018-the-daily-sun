He said in his demanding world, a typical day starts with planning what meal to prepare. “When you are a chef, it’s important to have a vision and patience,” he said. “I always ensure that I prepare the best food for the guests so that they can recommend our hotel to their friends and family.“After a hard day’s work, the rewarding part is going back home knowing that all my guests are happy and satisfied.“I also love cooking the best food for my family.”He said he will always be grateful to his former colleague, Blaise Duillueme, who was head chef at the hotel.“Blaise used to take such great pride in his meals,” he said.“Hotel guests would often praise him for the delicious food.“My wish is to one day prepare a meal for President Cyril Ramaphosa.” His advice to up-and-coming chefs?
