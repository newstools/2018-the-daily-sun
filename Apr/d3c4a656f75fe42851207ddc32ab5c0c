LWANDLE and Nomzamo kasis in Strand, near Cape Town have six dark and dangerous streets. They have been identified as a battleground following a series of robberies, assaults and murders. Lwandle police commander Colonel Xolani Williams warned residents to avoid the area or walk in groups when using Phaliso, Mgidlana, Michael, Shumani, Xaki and Lonja streets. “Thugs target workers and those who come from taverns in the early hours of the morning,” said Williams. “Street robberies occur when people are going to or from work. “We have already sent officers to patrol at these times, but there are no specific times that thugs pounce.” He urged residents not to wear bright designer clothes or shoes or use their cellphones while walking in the streets. “Bright clothes identify them from a distance. They must also try to walk in groups or walk on well lighted streets,” he said. Community Policing Forum chairman Siyabonga Macaula told Daily Sun that the issue of dangerous streets with no street lights had been brought to their attention. “We immediately notified both councillors Jongidumo Maxheke and Simthembile Mfecane because this is their duty as councillors.” Ward 85 councillor Mfecane said: “Since last month I have been busy working with officials regarding this matter. “They promised me that it would be fixed soon.”
