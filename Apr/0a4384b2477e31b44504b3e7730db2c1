TWO young boys have been left traumatised after finding the body of a family member on Tuesday morning. The boys, aged 15 and seven, from Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga discovered a dead woman hanging from the roof rafters in the garage. According to the boy’s gogo, the seven-year-old boy had woken up to find his mum was not in bed with him. “He thought she had gone running as she sometimes did,” said the gogo. “It’s only when her nephew (15) had finished preparing for school and was looking for a comb in the garage that he found her there.” The little boy ran back to the house, crying uncontrollably. “He told me his mum was hanging from the roof rafters in the garage. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the body.” The gogo said her daughter was happy at the weekend. “We had a family gathering on Saturday and she was happy. She didn’t look like someone who was having problems. “It’s difficult for us come to terms with her untimely death.” Thulamashe police spokesman Colonel John Ngwenya said an inquest docket has been opened.
