It is up to the investigations team to pursue the matter.”
 News24 has previously reported that there is no agreement between South Africa and the UAE. But that does not mean that South Africa cannot apply to the UAE to have a fugitive extradited. The process, however, will just be slightly more complicated than if a treaty had been in place.Mulaudzi said Ajay was wanted for charges unrelated to the Free State Vrede dairy farm case.Police ministry spokesman Vuyo Mhaga previously said they were working with the NPA on the state capture investigations. He said 13 warrants of arrest had been issued in Bloemfontein and Joburg.
