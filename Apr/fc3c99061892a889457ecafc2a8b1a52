FREE State Stars coach Luc Eymael could well be auditioning for the Kaizer Chiefs job with the two upcoming matches against Amakhosi. Even though he has yet to declare his interest in the position that he has been strongly linked to in recent weeks, Eymael is unlikely to turn down an offer to replace Steve Komphela at the helm of the Soweto giants.It is no secret that the Soweto giants have regressed in the last three seasons, so much so that they could possibly finish below Ea Lla Koto in the league standings this season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstnGwAGOErhvjI7idmxCqNhleBaRYwzEEyIIDdwvDupQH2nlCe66Nj-BsdFXLHGAsGm45xLL2n4OevhytBIZVCuxwtCQm_ZYj4_BBmJgkOOEC7pqxX8wbPKxmTPO1_FoTjijvZ4XXwSvEEfLmhlU_LxSWRb6jICSZOAsu5RFhKpVXAS0fEWN-zQDI2hgdrjsbL_5s30B7cZR3EA0NnuWoYU4MAyj_ZXnjjXpQuc3r52aykD9aL0ZSjq5Kf5ewD9V_fzYYA4-EXkQ6fbRqURlgqckg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP4MHev-TiFlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Belgian has already proved that his success at the unfancied Polokwane City was no fluke, and many have been raving about his work after he turned PSL no-hopers Ea Lla Koto into title contenders.Under Eymael, Stars are shining brighter than ever as they chase their first PSL silverware, having reached the Nedbank Cup semifinals on Saturday.In fact, Stars could determine Amakhosi’s fate this season in the two upcoming games.First, they host Chiefs inleague clash at Goble Park tomorrow (7.30pm) and then visit them for the Nedbank Cup semis on the weekend of 21 April.These matches will draw huge interest and will be seen by many as potential tests of Eymael’s credentials to guide Chiefs.Stars are adamant Eymael is going nowhere but Bobby Motaung’s overtures can be hard to resist.In the Absa Premiership, Stars are a point above the Glamour Boys, sitting pretty in fourth place with 37 points from 24 matches.A win for Eymael will certainly send him right up in the popularity stakes.It looks increasingly unlikely that Komphela’s contract will be renewed when it expires at the end of the season, even though Ke Yona might be his saving grace.But he is not impressed with the rumours that the club has already identified his successor.The former Bafana Bafana assistant coach sounded a warning to his potential successors, although he insisted he wasn’t hurt by the rumours.“Just a warning to my colleagues: Be careful what you wish for,” said Komphela.“Ambition kills. Leadership must be given, not demanded. Anybody who goes for power and demand power must be careful how power might handle them.“If I differ with a colleague who goes out there holding a job, I might just dust the table, go to his employer and say this guy is not loyal. He’s a hypocrite.“But it questions your integrity and honesty as a coach and as a professional to be holding a post and then be cutting someone else’s chair. There is a possibility that what you do to others, might happen to you. Do unto others as you wish they’d do unto you. It’s not me, but the Bible that says so.”As he faces his former team, Stars, Komphela will be buoyed by the performance of Pule Ekstein, the nippy midfielder who bagged the Man of the Match award against Baroka FC in their 1-0 cup win on Saturday. But poor finishing remains a source of concern for the coach.
