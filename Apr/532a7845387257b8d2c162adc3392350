Long weekends means you're free to spend spend your time however you please - even if it means doing nothing or the least as opposed to #themost. With the Freedom Day weekend coming up, below are four things you could do around SA in your city that's both within your budget and comfort zone city radius.  From visiting a local museum, reading a book or soaking in nature at your nearby park, indulging in tasty and budget friendly shnacks or catching a show or movie at your local cinema. Check out what's chilling around your city. The museum is open Mondays to Saturdays from 10h00 to 17h00. The museum is closed on Sundays, Worker's Day (which is Tuesday, 1 May) and Christmas Day. Entry charges:  Grab a book, your imagination, some snacks and relaxation at one of these free and chill parks.        MUSEUM: Swing by the Museum of Military History and take in the deep and rich lessons to be absorbed from your visit there. The museum is located at 22 Erlswold Way in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. You get an opportunity to study relevant artefacts on display, a guided tour - available on request during the week and an opportunity on weekdays (only) to use the extensive library and photographic facilities for research purposes.
