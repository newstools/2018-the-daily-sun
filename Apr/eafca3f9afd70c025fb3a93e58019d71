This backed up with practical inter-faith sessions in which he led as the President. "Throughout his term of office former President Zuma called for us as religious leaders to play a role in rebuilding this country. "He believed that religious leaders had to join hands in ensuring that government services reach the grass root communities to whom they are destined," said Ngcobo He said it was former President Zuma who guided religious leaders to be part of all efforts aimed at fighting HIV and Aids including TB. "He pointed out in various sessions that we must encourage people to take medication to completion.  "He mobilised us successfully to fight to eliminate the stigma associated with HIV, AIDS, TB and other diseases. He encouraged us to create a compassion net that makes people want to live and not give up for lack of hope."He said it was for that reason that they were working with law enforcement agencies.Ngcobo said the vigil would start at 18:30.
