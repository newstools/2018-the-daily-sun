morale of our police force but will instead encourage them to do even more to
continue to protect and serve our communities.”Nkosi-Malobane also said that in the last seven months,
about twelve Metro Police Officers have died on the line of duty in Gauteng
with five of these murders occurring in February.“This must stop; before we know we will be left with no one
to protect the good citizens of this country,” she said.Nkosi-Malobane also appealed to the Criminal Justice
System to expedite the case and give the perpetrators the harshest sentence.“This will send a strong message to the would be
perpetrators that such atrocities cannot be tolerated in our country,” she
said.On behalf of the Gauteng Provincial Government I would
like to send our heartfelt condolences to the Zulu family, friends and the
fellow JMPD members,” said Nkosi-Malobane.
