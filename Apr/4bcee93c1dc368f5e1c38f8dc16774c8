claimed that the child had fallen from the bed.Â 
However, medical test results revealed that the baby had
been raped. The mother was arrested and charged in terms of Section
55 of the Child Protection Act (aiding and abetting), child abuse and defeating
the ends of justice. She was detained since November 2017 after being denied
bail. One of the reasons for her bail having been denied, was
that during interviews with her, her version of what had happened to the baby
continually changed.This case was heard in the South Gauteng High Court since
6 November 2017.The prosecutor in this matter, Senior State Advocate
Alivera Du Plooy and Sergeant Lekgoathi worked tirelessly together on this case
and eventually achieved justice for the baby girl. The mother was convicted late last year and was yesterday
sentenced to life imprisonment despite the actual perpetrator not being
identified as yet. "This has set a precedent which will help prevent
any person from shielding perpetrators of crime in future," said police spokesman
Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo.The National Commissioner praised both Sergeant Lekgoathi
and Advocate Du Plooy for their hard work and dedication in this matter."Protecting the innocent and vulnerable is what we
seek to ensure on a daily basis and both Sergeant Lekgoathi and Advocate Du
Plooy have excelled in this regard", said General Khehla John Sitole."This may be little justice for the two month old
baby but the outcome of this case will surely serve to deter such criminality
from taking place again", said General Sitole.The identity of the mother will not be disclosed to
protect the identity of the baby.
