Court proceedings only resumed late in the afternoon after cops had restored order. The two accused had been arrested on Monday morning on suspicion of: - murdering two people - attempted murder - hijacking and robbery  - possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition -  kidnapping and  rape. They allegedly shot and killed Edwin Chichindua (47) and Bongani Letlhogile (42) and raped a 22-year-old woman.  North West cops spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said they had tried to rob a group of women walking from a tavern.  “The women screamed for help and Letlhogile and Chichindua allegedly saw what was happening and drove back to assist them,” she said. “They were shot at by the suspects and crashed into a fence.  “They were later found dead inside their vehicle while one of the women was seriously injured.”  Funani said the suspects then kidnapped one of the women and fled.  “She was allegedly raped by one of them,” she told the People’s Paper “The suspects were found in possession of a firearm and ammunition.”  Investigations revealed that the two are linked to several other cases.  They’re being kept in custody until 11 April when they’re expected to apply for bail.
