An Integrated Development Plan meeting descended into chaos
on Thursday evening, with petrol bombs thrown, numerous vehicles damaged and
parts of the N2 freeway being shut down for the evening."This culminated in last nightâ€™s horrific acts of
violence and criminality at the Colchester meeting, where councillors' vehicles
were stoned, and petrol bombs thrown," said councillor Nqaba Bhanga, who
is standing in for Mayor Athol Trollip while he is away.The meeting, which was being led by speaker of council,
Jonathan Lawack, and chief whip Werner Senekal, descended into chaos shortly
after it started, when a man wearing an Economic Freedom Fighters beret barged
into the meeting and started shouting at Lawack. The speaker asked the man to
leave, but another member took his place and continued to disrupt the meeting.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst4AhnlFZbfPbzwzvPVeNQ1CxkqACuXryCdRY7eCn32sR2EcDVkIfzG79XPiMAXuM9RtC3Mgrigr8QE0U8aOF46NOHF4SNklT6EpQ4KDC0w3DmURpsG9lZBlnNOnjU6o09cGYMZiqF_qIWPtsJHGmB0GQRSbSENZdpCmR1f5kUfRNnP1lDMulWDOzfdcUi7ZYS4Qhl6hg-B-26LoakWW-s7KpBg3vu9C5WDU3yiOMbevt_cXVGT0_9gpMxbreEMPI8QmUQA91WaRQYem-WhswXVtT-h8_U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMk1Gat8I8HJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

hall and barricaded those attending inside.Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said around 200
unhappy residents had barricaded the perimeter gate to the premises with
burning objects and had thrown rocks at the hall and the vehicles inside."Seven vehicles were damaged in the process," he
said.Beetge said members of the public order policing unit had
been called in and had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd and free the
occupants of the hall.N2 closed as protest spills overBeetge said some of individuals had then moved onto the N2
and barricaded the road with burning tyres and thrown rocks at passing
vehicles, which led to the closing of the road by law enforcement on both sides
for the majority of the evening.Beetge said a further nine vehicles, including trucks, had
been damaged by protesters before the roads had been closed. He said no one had
been injured in the incident, and that a case of public violence had been
opened.Member of the Mayoral Committee for Safety and Security John
Best confirmed that the roads had been closed by the local and provincial
traffic departments and that one person had been arrested, for setting a tyre
alight on the N2."The tragedy is that these meetings are there to engage
with the communities, to determine what their needs are, so that the municipality
can assist them. Yes, councillors were attacked, but it is the poor people of
the community who are the ones who actually suffer in the long term," he
