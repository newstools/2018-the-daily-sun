COPS are investigating claims that Julius Malema has received death threats. The EFF said on Tuesday Malema was being threatened. The national police commissioner has launched an investigation. Spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said their office received reports on the matter from Minister Bheki Cele. “We don’t discuss matters in the public domain regarding somebody’s security. However, since the matter is already out in public we can confirm that we are looking into the matter,” said Naidoo The EFF said they are strengthening their internal security. They told the ruling party and all right wing forces that resorting to violence will threaten peace. EFF acting spokeswoman Tebogo Mokwele said the party is not taking the threats lightly. She said reliable information indicates that politically insecure individuals in the North West have approached drug dealers and assassins, particularly the Western Cape, to assassinate in the EFF president. Mokwele said the threats are possibly because the EFF is on the verge of defeating the ANC in the North West in the upcoming general election. “These threats are also coming from right-wing forces who use social media, private caller identities and fake email platforms to pose death threats.”
