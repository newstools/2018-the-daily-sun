On Wednesday he returned, telling cops he wanted his car back and opened a false case,” he said.But then police recovered the vehicle and discovered the man’s cousin hadn’t been kidnapped. The man was arrested for perjury on Thursday. “He will appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court today. Investigations continue. “We appeal to the community to refrain from opening false cases as it derails the service needed by real victims of crime,” Mbele said.
