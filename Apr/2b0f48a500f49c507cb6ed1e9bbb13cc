FORMER Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf has launched a plea to South African footballers to go and ply their trade abroad in order to benefit senior national team.Diouf is currently in the country as part of a Moroccan delegation aiming to garner useful tips as they prepare to bid for the hosting rights of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in a few weeks’ time.The 37-year-old former Liverpool attacker paid a visit to SAFA House on Monday, and was left impressed by the rich history of the country’s football, which has featured stars such as Doctor Khumalo, Neil Tovey, Mark Fish and Lucas Radebe.He then admitted that the country boasts some of the best talent he has ever seen, before proceeding to urge the current crop of players to aspire to emulate the success of yesteryear’s Bafana Bafana heroes.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“I always wonder why South Africa can’t dominate the continent and world but players should lead the way by seeking bigger and better challenges overseas. When you play overseas, you become hardened, get proper experience and your technical ability will be of the highest standards,” Diouf told SAFA website. By playing overseas, the country’s Senior National Team will benefit immensely from that environment.“I spoke to Percy Tau and asked him what he was still doing in the PSL. The boy is good to play for any team in the world including Real Madrid or any of England’s top side. The boy is quality,” he said.Diouf appealed for PSL players never to be too comfortable playing at home.“South Africa players play the best football but need that international experience one only gets by playing in big European leagues. I always ask myself why there is no South African playing either in England or Spain yet the country has the most talented players. They are too comfortable playing at home; which is wrong.“The reason why South Africa did well in mid 1990s and late 90s was because the likes of Lucas Radebe, Benni McCarthy and Aaron Mokoena etc used to play overseas and their international experience told. Tau has no reason to still be playing in South Africa. He is more talented than Sadio Mane or even Mo Salah,” concluded Diouf.
