WHEN thugs broke into Johannes Mahlangu’s home on Friday and stole his fridge, food warmer, iron, TV and blankets, he was angry and heartbroken. But three days after consulting a sangoma he heard about in a taxi, the 66-year-old from Itsoseng in Soshanguve, Tshwane, had his belongings returned. Johannes said the sangoma gave him oil to sprinkle in his house. And three days later, he and his wife woke up to find all their stolen items outside the house. “We were shocked and happy. I believed I would get my stuff back because I had faith in the sangoma and I kept talking to my ancestors to help,” he said. Johannes said he didn’t open a case with the police because he didn’t believe they would help him. “The first time people broke into my house, the police came to take fingerprints but no suspects were ever arrested. “This time, I decided to try something different,” he said. When the SunTeam called the sangoma, who only identified himself as Doctor Jacobs, he confirmed Johannes was his client. “He came here crying and said someone had given him my number. I helped him get his things back. I’m happy that he’s happy,” he said.
