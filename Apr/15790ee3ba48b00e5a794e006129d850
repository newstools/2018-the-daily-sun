In the midst of repression, she was a voice of defiance and resistance."Ramaphosa said it was through her marriage to former president Nelson Mandela that Madikizela-Mandela rose to prominence."But it was through her own contribution, her sacrifice and her unyielding determination that she gained the love and the respect of the nation."Ramaphosa said, in the face of exploitation, the late struggle icon had been a champion of justice and equality."For many years, she bore the brunt of the senseless brutality of the apartheid state with stoicism and fortitude. Despite the hardships she faced, she never doubted that the struggle for freedom and democracy would succeed."He said Madikizela-Mandela remained, throughout her life, a tireless advocate for the dispossessed and the marginalised.As the country continued to mourn Madikizela-Mandela, Ramaphosa said the country must reflect on her rich, remarkable and meaningful life."Let us draw inspiration from the struggles that she fought and the dream of a better society to which she dedicated her life," he said.News24Sourcehttps://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mam-winnie-was-a-voice-for-the-voiceless-ramaphosa-20180402
