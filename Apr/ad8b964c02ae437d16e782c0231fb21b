City of Joburg MMC for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba said the celebration is long overdue. “I wish Bra Hugh was still alive to witness his talent being celebrated in this manner,” said Sifumba.  “As we celebrate Africa and Worker’s Month, I’d like to urge all of us to remember all African artists, those who passed on or are alive, who’ve entertained us with little or no recognition.”  Performances will include songs from Sarafina!, directed by Mbongeni Ngema; Songs of Migration directed by James Ngcobo and Gone Native: The Life and Times of Regina Brooks by Makhaola Ndebele. Ticket prices are from R150 to R300 on www.joburgtheatre.com
