VELA Nhlumayo (45) said he has been having sleepless nights since December. This is because his late mum, Mesta, who died when she was 77, comes to him in his sleep and threatens to turn his life upside down if he does not exhume her body. The 45-year-old from Bhobhoyi near Port Shepstone, on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal, told Daily Sun when his mum died in April last year his sister Lizi Makhanya (49) demanded that she be buried at her in-laws’ grave site in Dikwe Village. “My mum has been visiting my dreams and demands that she be re-buried at Paddock Cemetery where her family graves are,” said Vela. “The tension dates from a family feud that started when my mum was still alive.” Vela claims Lizi knew their mum wished to be buried with her family when she took her corpse away. “I kept quiet because I did not have a proper place to stay. “I can’t share the details of the feud but my mother died angry,” he said. Lizi did not reply to any of the SunTeam’s SMSes and only answered her phone once, saying: “I don’t want to talk about this matter.” Traditional Healers’ Council president Sazi Mhlongo said: “Vela will end up ill or dying because he frequently communicates with a dead person. He must exhume the corpse.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the matter could only be resolved by a court. “He should go to court and apply to exhume his mother’s body. “If his application is a success, he will be given a letter authorising an exhumation,” he said. Sbunge Mazubane, the induna of all the villages in Port Shepstone, said the matter would be taken to the inkosi. “We will also start working on mending relations between Vela and his sister,” he said.
