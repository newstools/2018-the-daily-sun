JOBURG Emergency Management Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi has strongly condemned two attacks on paramedics over the weekend. The first incident happened at about 7pm on Saturday while paramedics were attending to an assaulted man in Sandringham, northern Joburg. “The paramedics were busy treating the man when the person he had been fighting with earlier came back and shot at the ambulance,” said Mulaudzi. “The cops were called and took over the scene. Luckily, no one was injured.” Mulaudzi said 12 hours later, there was another incident when paramedics were attacked in Freedom Park, south of Joburg. They were apparently beaten and stoned by residents yesterday morning. “Officials were called to the scene of domestic violence in the area,” said Mulaudzi. “Paramedics and two firefighters based at Eldorado Park were attacked while attending to a woman who was badly beaten by her partner. “When they arrived at the scene, they certified the woman dead.” Residents became furious after the woman died and went on the hunt for her suspected murderer. “Paramedics were trying to stop the residents from assaulting the man when they turned against them.”
