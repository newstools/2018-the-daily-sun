SANDILE Mantsoe yesterday claimed a cop asked for a bribe to make his murder charge disappear. Mantsoe, who is accused of killing Karabo Mokoena last year, told the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg that Captain Bhekisisa Mhlongo took him to a room in the Sandton cop shop after arresting him. “He said I must not worry about what had happened. He said if I gave him something, he would let me go.” Mantsoe said Mhlongo left the room and later came back and asked him whether he had arranged something and he said no. Mantsoe said Mhlongo thought he was well-off because he lived in a nice flat and he had money in his bedroom. Mantsoe allegedly told Mhlongo on 10 May that he had killed Karabo, who went missing on 27 April last year. Mhlongo said the confession was made after he asked Mantsoe about a big dustbin he had been seeing carrying on CCTV footage. “He confessed to killing her. He told me he took her body and burnt it in Sandringham.” Earlier, Sergeant Matshidiso Maseko told the court cops suspected Mantsoe had murdered Karabo after they found bloodstains on his carpet. Mantsoe claimed Karabo killed herself in his flat and he burnt her body as he was afraid of being falsely accused. Constable Makaetji Mahwete said Karabo’s body was so badly burnt they couldn’t tell whether she was a man of woman.  She claimed she overheard Mantsoe tell other cops he had to do what he had to do.
