The child’s aunt told Daily Sun: “The bishop is roaming the streets as if nothing has happened.” The 45-year-old aunt from Mpumelelo Village in De Doorns, Western Cape, said the bishop was dating the 15-year-old girl’s mum when he started raping her. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssWWM5wE0NhlaCVZGYG6q20knQguLMFfmnglmZRbFck-Ox0-zgM4wcMQxVcS0UFQNTPYdB7S24sKc0cPGt-yn8D1MQU8Q5bfykTLxSgWdaq4-d-_fKCUvDz9JRxucR2Anub6s2Pp34oYD4fRepTEbBVsYNIQlIuQYySGZ_aHLrDC47x-QTV1hMHy9yEcCL7SoFEZjWf6hE3LGmTYU6yQxLUGlftMN0MrcueAjpkbkYtpn5N3DCeegXgIz7prvQWxg1b2Jax6u-ok0DVBbfXiCR6s8aQAieE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIYu0nDjXdYqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Councillor Phumzile Langata said after the girl’s family called him last week, he asked the bishop if he had raped her. “The bishop confessed he raped the child in 2013 and 2014 and asked for the matter to be resolved privately. I refused,” said Langata. A church member said they were shocked by the confession. “We trusted him and the fact that he confessed shows us he’s evil.”When residents heard about it, they threw stones at the bishop’s house. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said that Worcester police are investigating the case. He said the suspect has fled and had not been arrested yet.
