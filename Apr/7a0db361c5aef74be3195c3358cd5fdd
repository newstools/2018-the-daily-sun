Of course, he’s an important player. “He makes a difference every time he touches the ball.”The last time Roma faced Barcelona was in the Champions League group stage in November 2015, with the Catalans registering a thumping 6-1 home win over the Italians.Messi made his return from a two-month injury layoff in that game, running the show and scoring twice, as well as setting up Gerard Pique.Luis Suarez, who also struck twice against Roma in that match, was pleased with the team’s attitude against Sevilla.“It’s to Messi’s credit that he keeps demonstrating his class,” the Uruguayan forward said. “But the work of the whole team, to keep going and not give up, is what stays with me.”Barcelona looked lost at Sevilla until Messi arrived, especially without Sergio Busquets anchoring the team and controlling the game.The Catalan holding midfielder is back in training after a toe injury and could also start as Barcelona welcome Roma to their Colosseum for the first leg.“Andres Iniesta, our Michelangelo, Leo Messi, our emperor,” Barcelona declared in the video.While veteran playmaker Iniesta paints the path in midfield, it is only with Messi leading the charge that Barcelona can be confident of putting Roma to the sword and taking another step towards a potential treble. – REUTERS
