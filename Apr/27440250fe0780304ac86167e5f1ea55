Alter egos are becoming the new social media wave in South African pop culture. With the advent of social media stars like Lasizwe, Pharoahfi and Moshe Ndiki, our social media timelines are becoming more and more hilarious. And the latest alter ego to bring life to our screens is born through actor, musician and presenter, Khaya Dladla. The Gold Diva, as the alter ego is known, is a dramatic, middle-aged woman who is an aspiring singer. She is a parody of women who have the confidence level of Beyonce but with bad make-up, hair and a funny accent. The hilarious personality changes her wigs with each new video and wears the most dramatic make-up and jewelry imaginable. Thus far, we have seen Gold Diva perform songs such as Listen and Hello by Beyonce, and Wild Thoughts by DJ Khaled featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller. Hello ??‍????‍????‍??
