WHEN a woman failed to produce the jobs people in Wattville, Ekurhuleni had paid her for, they went wild. Yesterday they went to her shack to strip her of everything she owned. They demolished the building to sell the corrugated sheets and took her furniture and even food.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuj6fxpGGKskmMcS1Sks7cePS06gbPfI72RzfbGuhv-E2UaIGTeXbwY4s8NmyHyAe-oTyeLpNKmoDE12KjPJQtXsTIq3mjBKkFj1L4bXjIAC-V43iZliKIPljxao5cj8r5WytEszHQGyyP4n12z1sm-Ai_ml29fWWYzdkx3hj0-bnbUXcSKNbyZj-5NH-9IYjlopzWkuMqhnUrpgOrq_vlIPgM8W7Pg6qfTk6qxPEyyJHA0LL0aeBZz9t-ukOy96JHksKV9I25sL2Jg29F6X5xfMrM6G6c\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC4Ek7UnyKkkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

About 20 people told the SunTeam the woman had stolen more than R20 000 from them. They said she asked for between R1 000 and R1 300 for placements.They said they called the cops, who said there was nothing they could do as the money had been handed over voluntarily. The woman has since disappeared. Dina July said they met the woman in December and she told them she worked for a detergent company in Boksburg. Jabu Babale said: “In January we were supposed to start our new jobs, but she kept on ducking and diving.“We became suspicious when we investigated and found she was only a cleaner working on contract. “She is a smooth talker. We believed everything.”Jabu said the woman was a polished con artist. “She used several SIM cards. She asked other people to call us, pretending to confirm the information on our CVs, and they told us when we were supposed to start working.” Jabu said they were told they would start working in January, but she then began avoiding them.
