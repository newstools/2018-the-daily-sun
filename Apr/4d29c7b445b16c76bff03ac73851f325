SANDILE Mantsoe allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend, Karabo Mokoena, to break a blood bond they shared. This was what Constable Mokgaetji Mahwete told the South Gauteng High Court yesterday. She said Mantsoe told her Karabo introduced him to a person called Master, who performed a ritual to unite their spirits. “He told me he was warned not to break up with her because if they did, they would have to give a sacrifice,” said the cop. She said Mantsoe told her Karabo stabbed herself in the neck and mixed her blood with his to take to Master so that their bond could be broken. “Sandile told me he was supposed to take the mixed blood to Master 14 days after the sacrifice, but the accused was arrested before he could do that,” she said. Captain Rodgers Mahundla said Mantsoe told him Karabo had committed suicide. According to Mantsoe, he and Karabo had a fight on 28 April and he left the flat.When he returned, Karabo was lying on the floor bleeding from the neck. Mahundla said Mantsoe told him he panicked and got rid of the body because he did not think people would believe he had not murdered her.
