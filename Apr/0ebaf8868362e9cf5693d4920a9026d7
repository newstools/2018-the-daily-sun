We had a hell of a run in the second round, I think the best in the league out of everybody. The first round was disastrous and that’s why we are playing catch-up. We have to knuckle down and battle on until the end of season to see how much (points) we can get.”Having dropped down from the Caf Champions League following a 3-2 defeat on penalties to Angolan side Primeiro de Agosto on 17 March, Hunt emphasised the importance of winning the Confed Cup.“Every game is very important. We want to do well and keep playing. We drew with Primeiro and lost on penalties.”However, the outspoken mentor is not happy with Enyimba’s attempts at playing mind games.“We don’t even know when Enyimba are arriving although we have to arrange everything for them on this side. We don’t even know where we are playing that side (in the second leg) – it’s not even in Lagos.”Hunt credited their great run in the second round, where they are currently unbeaten in nine games, to a change in attitude from players. “It’s just one thing, if the attitude is right you can achieve things. That’s how we won three trophies in 14 months. The attitude is good and we can still finish well. We won a cup (Telkom Knockout), we sold players, what more do you want?”Hunt hailed the versatile Keagan Ritchie, who grabbed the opener on Tuesday before Mohau Mokate levelled matters. Buhle Mkhwanazi grabbed the winner. Explained the coach: “I thought Ritchie was Man of the Match today. He always played left back at Kaizer Chiefs, but he is a central midfield player. In my opinion he was magnificent tonight, has good balance and keeps the ball well.”
