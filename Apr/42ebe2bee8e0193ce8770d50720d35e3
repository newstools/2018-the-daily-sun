The families of the victims didn’t want to talk to the SunTeam, saying they were afraid as one suspect was still at large. When Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area last week, residents told him the shooters were foreigners but he warned them against making accusations without proof. “You can’t say it’s them because you don’t have proof of what you are talking about. You are going to confuse us now,” Cele said at the time.However, resident Nkosekhaya Mlungwana said they ended up being right about the suspects. “They must not get bail. We hope these people rot in jail,” said Nkosekhaya. Another resident said they knew the suspects as they lived in Philippi. The suspects will remain in custody until their next appearance on Monday.
