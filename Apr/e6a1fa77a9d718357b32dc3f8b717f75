SUPPORTERS of former president Jacob Zuma have vowed to bring Durban to a standstill today.A pre-night vigil march will start at midday at the Durban University of Technology’s Steve Biko campus and is expected to move through the busy Warwick Junction to Pixley kaSeme Street. Sboniso Khomo, one of the organisers, told Daily Sun yesterday that the march will end at Albert Park in the city centre, where supporters will hold a night vigil before Zuma’s court appearance, scheduled for tomorrow. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Zuma is facing 16 charges including corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering. “The charges must be withdrawn.“Nothing will move in Durban today because people are angry that Zuma is being victimised by white monopoly capital. “We as ordinary and small businesses regard Zuma as the father of radical economic transformation, so we took it upon ourselves to defend him to the death,” he said. Khomo asked why charges were brought back after the Seriti Commission, which had been set up to investigate corruption in the arms deal tender, found nothing against the former president. He warned motorists to avoid Warwick Junction and Pixley kaSeme Street to make way for marchers. He refused to say what political position he held and said he was organising the march in his personal capacity. The National Interfaith Council of South Africa, Black First Land First, National Funeral Practitioners’ Association of South Africa and the Delangokubona Business Forum have confirmed that they will join the march and also the night vigil.This was stated by the leaders of the groups during a joint media briefing in Durban yesterday.Meanwhile, KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said cops from different units will be at all hot spots in the city to monitor the movement of the crowds. Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, spokesman for the eThekwini Metro Police, said no roads will be closed but the police will block traffic for the marchers to pass, then reopen the roads again.
