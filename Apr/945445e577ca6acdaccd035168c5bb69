IT seems Home Affairs is taking a leaf out of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s book. Minister Malusi Gigaba declared a war on queues after Ramaphosa’s call to officials to set their watches correctly. Gigaba was speaking to the media at the department’s Umgeni offices in Durban yesterday, which he was visiting as part of the War on Queues campaign. He started off at the Pietermaritzburg office. Umgeni is among of the many Home Affairs offices in the country where people have made many complaints about poor service. Gigaba said: “We need to provide quality service to our people and restore their dignity. I really don’t want to hear a story of a person who committed suicide because they did not get the assistance they needed.” He said the campaign is nationwide and they want to see what problems the people have so those can be sorted out. Gigaba said Umgeni was identified as needing intervention. “It seems this office serves more people than it should. “This means we need to have more offices here in Durban,” said the minister. Resident Nozibele Msimango (45), said she was happy with the minister’s visit. “I have been here since 6.30am to apply for my granddaughter’s birth certificate but I have not been assisted yet. “Queues end up getting longer and longer. This has to stop,” Nozibele said.
