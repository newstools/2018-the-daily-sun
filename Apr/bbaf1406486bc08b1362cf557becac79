RESIDENTS of Melmoth in northern KZN named their high school Phumosizini, hoping it would live up to its name. But yesterday the residents said they were disappointed.Parents were happy when the school was built in the late 1990s as this meant their kids would no longer have to walk long distances. The school had also secured the services of a security guard. Then, according to the parents, the guard left the school in 2015. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst5rXcZ6jE4k7QuIggu2VEc-lsqOo8A4rCmSiMXZpzshZzXbMIkB4AuN6ejP1b6-4R5uYdHZSXcs_QRORaf7OaUiVh-43bt662WEf5NnxgNF7lJo0KSPO2ftuvDVwHaAW_v-fcgekvP5lXgoJ6QuYLOqQHzoJdVubDEhwAUzq3OvS8a6DUb54XcjE1rV0785A7Omk5KfQEYJfiPnm9hOv2k2fsZHz9zYm34jFNOXcx7EFv3_NJAqYN9aYvOO5lRpDh-Etw1cpzPYM6U7ZrLJDQrZwBmKow\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNmxmEUegmMUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

SGB chairman Bongumusa Sibiya said: “We want to know why the guard left and why he was not replaced.”KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi refused to comment. Instead he asked: “Why don’t you ask the paper to report about the launch we are attending?”KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the police went to the school to monitor the situation.He said no case was opened because it was a peaceful protest.
