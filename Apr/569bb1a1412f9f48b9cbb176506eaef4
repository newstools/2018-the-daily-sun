I miraculously crawled out alive but my whole body aches,” she said.“I’m an orphan and unemployed. All my groceries, clothes and ID were buried deep in the rubble.”Yandiswa told Daily Sun she doesn’t know how she will survive.“Luckily my kind neighbour gave me a place to stay.”Nombeko Bhelimane (51) said she watched helplessly as her houses collapsed one after the other.The mother of four said: “Only one house was left standing but it looks as if it will also cave in at any moment. We slept on wet beds that night. “I hope the government will give us temporary shelter and repair our homes.”Gogo Gladys Mntonintshi said she had a lucky escape.“I rushed out of my house and it tumbled down a few seconds later,” she said.Two local churches were completely destroyed.OR Tambo municipal spokesman Ayongezwa Lungisa said a task team would visit the area to access the damage. “They will come back with recommendations on what has to be done to get people’s lives back on track,” he said. Eastern Cape Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said 18 people from Ntokozweni Village were injured and admitted to Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital.“One of them is in a critical condition.”
