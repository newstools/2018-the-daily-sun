Both memorial and funeral services will he held at Orlando Stadium so people can pay their respects to the struggle icon. The memorial service was first planned for Regina Mundi Catholic Church but more people are expected to attend than the venue could accommodate. That memorial will be on Wednesday and the funeral will take place next Saturday. Mama Winnie will be laid to rest at Fourways Memorial Park in Joburg. There will be condolence books at airports, parliament, Tuynhuys, the Union Buildings and the department of arts and culture.
