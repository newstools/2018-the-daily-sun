ADVOCATE Tembeka Ngcukaitobi launched his book, The Land is Ours: Black Lawyers and the Birth of Constitutionalism in South Africa, at the Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha. Lawyers, students and deputy ministers were in attendance. He called on blacks to engage in the land debate in a serious, responsible manner by getting the facts right. “The land is ours. By ours, I mean people who were colonised, dispossessed and subjugated. Those were African people.” He’s an alumni and did his undergraduate law degree there when the varsity was still called the University of Transkei. He said he hoped for a more intelligent debate about the history of the Constitution and of the land through the book. “I believe we have a lot to say about land, but very little insight into how the land question historically came to where we are,” he said. “How did 1913 come about. How did the people affected by 1913 respond to it. “So I want to start a conversation so that South Africans can be informed about what to say about the land question.” Ngcukaitobi was referring to the hated Natives Land Act of 1913.
