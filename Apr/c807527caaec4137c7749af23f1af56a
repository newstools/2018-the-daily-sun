TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila FC are not for sale! There have been rumours that the troubled National First Division side will be sold to Mpumalanga outfit Acornbush United for R12 million. But Masala Mulaudzi, owner of the Venda side, told SunSport yesterday that they had already started planning for next season after failing to gain automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership or qualify for the promotional play-offs. Mulaudzi bought Cape Town-based Milano United FC last year, moved it to Limpopo and renamed it Tshakhuma, but rumour has it that the Venda businessman has found it financially challenging to run the club. “This is news to me. This team is going nowhere – I can promise you that,” he said. “Why would I sell the team after we did so well this season? Our goal was to maintain our status and gain experience in the NFD. I believe we have achieved that. “This is not just my team, it’s for everyone in Venda. If we want to sell we would have to consult the fans who have been behind the team this season. No, I am not selling.” He added: “It has been a challenging season for us as new boys in the league. But we have learned from our mistakes and we want to rectify them next season.” Tshakhuma are sixth in the table with 38 points and two games remaining to end the season. Mulaudzi said it was time to support their Venda rivals, Black Leopards, as they chase a promotional play-offs spot. Leopards, under interim coach Joel Masutha who was fired by Tshakhuma, are second in the standings with 47 points and just need one win to cement their play-offs spot. They are just ahead of another former PSL side, Jomo Cosmos, who are third and trailing by one point. “It will be good for Leopards to go back to PSL,” he said. “It would mean a lot for football growth in Venda. So it’s time for us to support them and hope that they will get a chance to play in the promotional play-offs to make us proud. “It would be nice to have a PSL and NFD team in Venda next season!”
