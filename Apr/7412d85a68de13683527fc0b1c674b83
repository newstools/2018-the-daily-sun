Instead it was a gem of a free-kick that was deposited into the top corner by a curling Kabwe effort from 25 yards out.Fagrie Lakay then forced a good low save from Mbatha, before substitute Tashreeq Morris twice came close to of scoring as the match was turned on its head.Then came the winning goal as Zwane could not get out of the way of Karuru’s free-kick from the right.To Ajax's credit, they did not throw in the towel and came close to a share of the spoils when another outstanding Kabwe free-kick rocked the crossbar as AmaZulu held on.
