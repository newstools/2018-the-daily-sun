Yesterday thousands gathered at Orlando Stadium in Soweto to say their final goodbyes to the departed Mother of the Nation Mama Winnie Madikizeka- Mandela.It was here that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema left a lot of people shook after he gave what many have described as the best speech of his entire political career.In his speech, Malema slammed those who had “humiliated” Mama Winnie while she was still alive, many of whom were present at her funeral crying louder than those who actually cared for her.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuiTfpZYuhbpQ5Td1MxKTO4TL2hdgCT8VCFa9Hq-smapl5z0Pc8voLVFxh1cinIjcdXWj3UySL7fczeVrjvXoK4zhJQNun6ABogvGHqq1fDWD7QbaX_-rVcja_QfdW-J-Fl9o3de03fPRkx-CBK_Z4PQC2k6B48dH5j4vlCRcw0R9Rv7DrCeeO30r_w6CyCQBCR4FEOW-oVm9EcQ5UUKTftMyOf6m79k44-Kd0itFIJZPQJcQAAUlSEA4sv_C9t6b_QVaBgL3Y5mxAOQyK1h-ATvttpysBo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM15PqYtFMcBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
