She went on to quote the Freedom Charter.“Free healthcare and hospitalisation will be provided for all, with special care for mothers and young children. “We can no longer have a situation where the media tells about food and medication shortages. “We should be the first to know so we can immediately rectify the situation. This must end today.”The Wits Consortium will offer clinical governance and leadership programmes for the department’s executive managers.
