BOXING SA’s Gauteng service provider, Archie Nyingwa, might face disciplinary action after he punched ring announcer Sipho Mashego in the face, SunSport has learnt. The heated argument between Nyingwa and Mashego led to the former boxing trainer unleashing a “warm klap”. BSA members and stakeholders were returning from the funeral of the former SA champion, Norman “Pangaman” Sekgopane, in Mahikeng, North West, on Saturday. The incident apparently took place at OR Tambo airport when they returned the rented cars. Mashego alleges all hell broke loose when they reached the car rental, with the boxing manager wanting to know where the other two cars were. Said Mashego: “Archie asked me ‘where are the other cars’. I told him I only saw one and he started attacking me verbally, asking why I didn’t see Jan Bergman, who was driving one of the cars. I lost my cool and told him that I was tired of his conduct and all his disrespect. He swore at me and punched me in the face with a clenched fist, wrapped around his phone.” But the former boxing trainer says he klapped Mashego because he was drunk and driving recklessly. “Mashego almost caused an accident. He was drunk and driving recklessly. I klapped him because he did not want to listen. As a father figure I was rebuking him,” said Nyingwa. However, Mashego, who opened an assault case with BSA, says Nyingwa is lying. “He is a liar, his statement is a defence mechanism. If I was drunk why did he allow me to drive? He should have reported me to BSA. I had a glass of diluted whisky, that’s what I had,” he said. Said Bergman, who was with them: “He was not drunk, he only had a double tot.” BSA CEO Tsholofelo Lejaka says these are serious allegations. “Inquiries will be made and action taken.”
