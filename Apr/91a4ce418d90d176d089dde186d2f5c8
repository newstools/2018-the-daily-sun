Acting hopefuls are fuming this evening after spending the entire day at an audition that allegedly was never meant to happen. SABC 1 recently made a call for aspiring actors to come and audition for a new, unnamed drama series coming to the channel. The auditions were meant to happen today in Rosebank, Johannesburg but apparently, that did not happen. Those who went to the auditions have taken to social media to express their outrage over what they feel was a scam. “Thanks for scamming us with fake open auditions. You are truly pushing us to withdrawing our support. You deserve failure,” one hopeful said. Meanwhile, the crowd was so big, the police had to be called in to keep order. ICYMI: SABC 1 LOOKING FOR FRESH TALENT Some people have said that upon arrival, they were just told that there are no auditions taking place at the venue, while another said they were told to audition through an agent despite this having been advertised as an open audition. “So many young people came in numbers for nothing....ds is s**t,” another tweeted. Entertainment commentator, Phil Mphela says this should be a lesson. “What's happening in Rosebank at the auditions that were cancelled should be a lesson to producers to stop playing with aspiring performers' dreams and yearning for opportunities. Respect people's time & hopes. Somebody messed up here and ought to take responsibility,” he said. The SABC is yet to comment.
