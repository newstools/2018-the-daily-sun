A HOME OWNER was shocked on Friday when his neighbour came to tell him she had seen two women leaving his house with a TV covered in a blanket. The 44-year-old from Montsu section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, immediately sprang into action and ran after the women, who were bust and handed over to the police. Police spokesman Captain Manyaza Railidziba said the women, aged 21, were arrested and charged. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsse9d2S7CZd2QNBh8oxIffa-glar7wUk3LZKJIVWDsHLiDLXK4ZN8l2qq7ad_1byWrDXLGCtmrmrVSCMBlVkII77AHkdhX5vwhjdSaCFQ-hq2L7Q3HcUW4-z2Do0zFaYp8xdXw3l7xyCZtVRv2XOB0Ylno2_pyk9oCNhbhK3M2_-d6qd3R4ChADaoopiGqyQ7_UHb3csgyqBFlPqBa_99tPFdhQLn8ED9sfcoE0ztO8FGWHUhNeeWhzjyMxyUS670swM5tF3df2Rh60DhIdfd7dfyJo5Zk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLNZHjMWcC2nEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The women were detained at Tembisa Police Station and will soon appear in court for housebreaking, theft and possession of suspected stolen property. The police thanked residents for allowing them to do their job instead of taking the law into their own hands.
