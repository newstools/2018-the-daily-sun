Police spokesman Captain Manyaza Railidziba said the women, aged 21, were arrested and charged. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvcsWfDKXddqah0-vU655BtBbqmoSsymqLJM4uPjLeZchaDM0RHBkgewfnF6o7OTawMoego0qOOOEZz1UDGHZTvzHzOZRaCfJ1lXK-C5nW0t5DP9xqkP4qD2RtG1mlXvD0E0Ot8Q2I_hhe8VFfsJvWdgO_EMWOgWEGkIrJU0djAhRnwiAX4Y-OtNnj6G1RQoRwNj5JVCKZ0uL0-b3p0jjEARgvkQmsRKT3ZDxtQOIKRTg1qfjjyhQnYMsAyTK_ZQJmZFxhxWrhUGKbpvvE69ESSuUtV6zs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJNx4SHeqlX-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The women were detained at Tembisa Police Station and will soon appear in court for housebreaking, theft and possession of suspected stolen property. The police thanked residents for allowing them to do their job instead of taking the law into their own hands.
