TV personality Pearl Thusi and rapper Cassper Nyovest are the latest celebrities to have a go at each other on Twitter. After Sizwe Dlomo had two heated exchanges on Twitter first with Euphonik and then with the DA’s Helen Zille, Thursday saw Pearl Thusi and Cassper take their turn at proving just how little it takes to turn Twitter into a war-zone. It all started when Pearl tweeted that she fell from a horse and suffered minor injuries. Cassper had no sympathy for Pearl asking “What were you doing on a horse wena as a black woman? Certain things should be left to white people, don’t you think? That’s what you get for Ukuphapha!!! Yegela Izinto za belungu wena black girl magic!!!” Needless to say, Pearl was not impressed by the rapper’s reply and she gave him a piece of her mind. “So you believe black women should be limited? You’re narrow minded self also doesn’t know black people were riding horses on our continent for centuries?! And now as a black woman I must be confined to YOUR LIMITS. Nigga GTFOH,” she said. The Tito Mboweni hit-maker did not understand why Pearl was so offended by his tweets but in the end the two tried to sort out their differences away from the Twitter streets.
