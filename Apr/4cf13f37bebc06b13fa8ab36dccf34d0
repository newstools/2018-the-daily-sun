Tony Leon has labelled allegation that he was behind the persecution
of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as a lie.Speaking on Leon's behalf since he is mourning his father's
death, former DA Chief Whip Douglas Gibson said if Leon had not openly and
publicly called for an investigation he would have been failing in his duty as
Leader of the Opposition."Any suggestion of an involvement with Stratcom before
1994 when he was the Opposition Justice spokesperson, or afterwards, when he
was the Leader of the Opposition to the ANC government is a ridiculous
lie.  Tony Leon was doing his job and any
allegation that he was “behind” the persecution of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is
also a lie."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>This follows former safety and security minister Sydney Mufamadi's response to claims in a documentary that he was behind a probe into Winnie
