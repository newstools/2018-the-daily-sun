The FNB sports Stadium could collapse if illegal mining
is not tackled. This is according to Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba. According to Mashaba, Joburg buldings risks facing structural
damage due to the use of explosives near highways by zama zamas. Mashaba has written a letter to Minister of Mineral
Resources Gwede Mantashe for intervention. “The consequences of the illegal use of explosives in
decommissioned mines have disastrous consequences for the residents of
Johannesburg as it can lead to serious injuries, loss of life and will put an
enormous strain on our emergency services should a burst pipeline give to rise
to a fire,” he said. Mashaba said that Last year, he called for a collaborative
crackdown operation with the Department of Mineral Resources, Department of
Home Affairs, Department of Roads and Transport, JMPD, SAPS and Hawks to tackle
illegal mining activities. “Of significance is the Nasrec precinct where the
pipelines intersects with SASOL gas lines. “ Investigations have revealed that if illegal mining
activity continues within these old mining shafts, the entire FNB Nasrec
precinct, including the iconic FNB stadium, could go down in ruins as a result
of unstable earth directly underneath the area,” he said. According to Mashaba, illegal mining and the use of
explosives has resulted in tremors, which risks the structural integrity of the
City’s roads.
