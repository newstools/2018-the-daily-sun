Cops spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo told Daily Sun: “We’re investigating two murder cases and an attempted murder case.  “This comes after cops were called to a house in Blarney Street and found two female bodies with bullet wounds.”  Mbambo said the motive for the attack is unknown and investigations are continuing.  Police suspect the shooting happened at about midnight and that the terrified survivor, a seven-year-old child, waited until the next morning to seek help.  They’ve asked anyone with any information about the murders to come forward.  “We’re calling on anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the culprits to contact Detective-Colonel Berry Senatla on 082 453 0792,” said Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe. He said a team of experts was following leads.
