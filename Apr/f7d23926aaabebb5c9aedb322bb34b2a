THE battle for land between Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and shack dwellers is heading for court. This was announced at a meeting held outside Daku hall in KwaZakhele kasi on Sunday. Speaking at the meeting, Mxolisi Moolman, representing the shack dwellers, said: “The law says if people have occupied the land for more than six months, the municipality has no right to evict them without building them RDP houses. “Secondly, the metro was supposed to give you warning by putting up a warning board. We need affidavits from you and we will make a court application to stop the metro evicting you.” ANC Councillor Rory Riordan said: “The metro violated council’s decision. We took a resolution that the shacks should not be demolished.” Mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza said: “We are only following an order. “President Cyril Ramaphosa said land invasion is outlawed and it must be dealt with.”
