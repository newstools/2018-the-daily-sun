AN 11-year-old boy died on Wednesday after stealing money from home. According to his mother Vuyelwa Mpopo from Bekkersdal, Mogale City, Pele Mpopo stole R200 to buy a packet of chips. “A few minutes after he left the house, I was told he had collapsed in public. “When I got there, I was shocked to see his motionless body. Nobody knows what happened to him,” said Vuyelwa. Vuyiswa Nchaupe, the boy’s aunt, said the money was for his school fees. “When I was told my nephew had collapsed, I rushed to the scene and an ambulance was called. But by the time it arrived, it was too late,” said Vuyiswa. Ruth Lubisi (24) said Pele bought the packet of chips from her. “He told me he would come back for his order but he never did,” said Ruth. The family suspects Pele might have been given something poisonous to drink. “The post mortem reveals he died from poisoning. “The person who did this might have taken advantage of him because he had a lot of cash. “He must have followed him from the shop where he bought the chips,” said his uncle, Terence Mpopo. Vuyiswa said the family needs the person who did his to come forward so they can get closure. “We will forgive that person. We are haunted by the fact that we don’t know who did this,” she said. An inquest has been opened at Bekkersdal Police Station.
