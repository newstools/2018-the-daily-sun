VUSI Zulu will spend 15 years in jail after being found guilty of killing his madala, Allen Zitha (67). The 43-year-old was sentenced by the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga on Friday. The former parolee from Goromani Trust near Mkhuhlu, Bushbuckridge was sentenced to 12 years for attempted murder. But he only served half the sentence before being released on parole in 2015. During the mitigation of sentence, Zulu asked the court to at least give him 10 years. “I regret trying to end a quarrel between madala and a group of men because now I’m labelled a murderer. I swear I didn’t kill him and I don’t even know how he died. “But unfortunately I’m the one going to jail for a murder I didn’t commit,” Zulu told the court. Prosecutor Matume Maake said Zulu never acknowledged his action and denied killing his madala. Magistrate Elmarie Theron said the sentence given to Zulu would serve as an opportunity for him to reconstruct his life under the supervision of correctional services.
