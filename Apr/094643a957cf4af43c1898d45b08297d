TWO families are preparing funerals after two boys drowned in a trench on Sunday. Thabo Mosupye (9) and his best friend Kgaogelo Ngobese (8) drowned near their homes in Thulare, Lebotlwane in the North West on Sunday. Their families told Daily Sun that they were trying to work out why the kids went to the ditch in the first place. Thabo’s aunt, Eva Mosupye (29), said they were walking with her to the taxis. “But I told them to turn back because I was going far,” she said. Eva said when she got home she called her sister, Mmasebueng Mosupye (35), to let her know she had arrived safely. That’s when she got the shocking news. “Mmasebueng told me Thabo and Kgaogelo were found dead. I felt numb and weak because I was the last person who saw them alive,” she said. Mmasebueng said she rushed to the trench after some kids came to call her. When she got there, bystanders told her the boys had disappeared in the water. “A man and his son went in to find them. They found their bodies after searching for a few hours,” she said. Kgaogelo’s mother Lilian Ngobese (38) said the boys usually played around the village and didn’t go far. “I don’t know why they went there. The water there is deep,” she said. North West police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Pelonomi Makau said an inquest was docket was opened.
