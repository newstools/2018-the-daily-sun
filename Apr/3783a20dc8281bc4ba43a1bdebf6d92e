“THE City of Cape Town continues to take a zero tolerance approach to land grabs across the metro.” Those were the words of Cape Town informal settlements MMC Xanthea Limberg. Limberg spoke to the People’s Paper after shacks were demolished in Dali squatter camp, Philippi East, on Thursday. “Many invaded areas are reserved for future housing projects, roadways or industrial developments that will create jobs,” said Limberg. She said land invasions put basic and emergency services at risk. Resident Nomxolisi Sajini (36) said no one told them they were not allowed to build shacks on the vacant piece of land. “If we knew we were not wanted here, we would’ve have gone somewhere else,” she said. Nomvuyo Thangani (38) said the residents had only been there for three weeks. “When the City marked our shacks, we realised it was time to move. “They marked and demolished our shacks on the same day. “What they did to us was cruel,” said Thangani. Many of the residents were at work when their shacks were demolished. Khuselwa Ngubelanga (33) looked after her friends belongings after her shack was demolished. “I helped my friends because criminals could come and take what was left of their possessions. The City destroyed everything.” A group of defiant residents said they would continue to build shacks there. “They have already damaged our building material and belongings. “They can carry on,” said one resident. The residents said they built shacks because they could no longer afford to rent rooms. “Most of the people in this community are unemployed,” said a resident. “We can’t afford to keep renting rooms. That’s why we build these shacks here. The City must just leave us alone.”
