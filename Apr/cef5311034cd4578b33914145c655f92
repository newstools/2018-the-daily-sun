EFF Leader Julius Malema appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate
Court on charges of inciting land grabs on Friday morning.The case was postponed because Malema brought an application to challenge the
constitutionality of the law used to charge him.The law that was used to charge him is the Riotous
Assemblies Act and led to the postponement of the case as it is still to be heard in court.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu6KoI3DNyxWoveCLanrVBpmfSz-xcwt4HyolyKQz17JNY5vDdDKmKoIIUYKagZ9W7w0vH7bv7mFzhsd8Wnk2rUqueGYHPEjqAOj6QXkwVlNWJXN1ByTtdPPLxg81KSrKdKg79LqOIbsE2KvnOIKjvVbtVQ8p4XcsCeMHLFKSfmL7vBBViOFYBABJ2Xvkiwgen34RgNa6ZT4bDwzDDsJHUjG2G9YRC7-p6FYBhPiBWlzIDYZ8u997ozlrNOe9lTMUwj09a7QnNl60pi1cdQPsoMjToTgHI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDdYOur_1S5uEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

2014, that they we're going to occupy unoccupied land because they need the
land. "For us to eat‚ we must have the land. For us to work‚
we must have the land. I come from Seshego - If there is unoccupied land‚ we
will go and occupy the land with my branch. You must go and do the same in the
branch where you come from," Malema said.
