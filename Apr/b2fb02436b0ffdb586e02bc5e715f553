Several  trucks were torched and damaged along the N3 freeway near the Mooi River Toll Plaza on Sunday night. Cops said that a group of people began throwing objects on the N3 freeway and set some trucks alight at around 19:30. Cops spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that a total of 35 trucks were damaged including those that were set alight. "It is believed that the people who were protesting and throwing stones as well as burning objects had causing extensive damages to property. Local police and neighbouring police stations were mobilised and dispersed a number of people who were looting the burning trucks," said Mbele.  A total of 54 people were arrested and will face charge of public violence. The arrested suspects will appear at the Mooi River Magistrates’ Court on Monday. " The situation is calm today although the road is still blocked due to the trucks that were burnt. "Police are still monitoring the situation and are on high alert. Traffic is being diverted onto alternative routes for now," he said. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa has strongly condemned the unlawful protest action. “This is totally unacceptable and we will not condone people venting their anger by damaging private and public property or blockading our national roads. We will intensify our operations and ensure that those responsible face the full might of the law. Any person who blocks our national roads will be treated as an ordinary criminal and will face the full might of the law. There are many avenues for people to voice their grievances and resorting to criminality is definitely not one of them,” he said.
