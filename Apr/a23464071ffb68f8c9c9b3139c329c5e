THE late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela
was an ANC member but she also belonged to South Africa.That was according to EFF leader Julius Malema who
was speaking outside the home of mama Winnie during his visit on Tuesday.“We are saying to the ANC, Winnie belonged to you,
she was your member, but she belonged to South Africa too and we own her as
well.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstDv2b5_ryAl6J9xSyS0rfj0-lH_Cq1Psm4K0lV2ubuBvqwlQlvlji4uY18p8CEVuqJ2eWF3pCemam9ZGP1BcQfjDFmXDTyJuGP6daMcc9gR3vxsWBiLokpEp4ePXnU8QANbHdcvU5da94GXIukqdp7dGfHDNM3AuuqX7xTrfl2ucqK2a7ZFiehN5bemGIc_IIrZ7XdOXIF6UxSSCTJTaYLWlC9BFF5tyy3r2NgTXJoTLSO8NBPJQfBHwXgsShXi2AJfrVAr4_BdICtr8oVjl5U1nEXIKU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK13PTxOtik2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

here.”He said they didn’t need to ask directions to come
to mama Winnie’s house because it is also their home.“How many times did Winnie Mandela say “viva
EFF?”Malema asked.He said as the EFF they will also be at the
memorial service.Malema described Madikizela-Mandela as the stone
that was rejected by the builder.“Winnie Mandela is the president we didn’t have.
Who was denied to be president on the bases that she was a female and African
for that matter?“They feared her, even today they still fear her in
her death, that is why they continue to call her names and characterized her in
the matter that we don’t know.”
