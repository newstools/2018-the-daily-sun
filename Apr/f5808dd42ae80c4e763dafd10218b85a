THE one moment Chippa United are flirting with relegation, the next they are competing for a top eight position.That is the wonder of this Absa Premiership season, where the gap between teams is tighter than ever before.Thumped 2-0 by Mamelodi Sundowns midweek, Chippa went into the game against Kaizer Chiefs last Saturday a step away from relegation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvH-A2SWozCFfxEgG_eugAylKAmG0tycAN0n2-W2Lq1DmNVQ5GtiJk5duPODbUW4Tzi13nf6HmgaRjWPl1smsIs_SM7xyBaTNFxSqvF4dK-1LaoAcSOMWkc4CqcLSaFoDM4sME1U6WPa1vcELg1Lo9uYkayajOaqIsbRPlhk3OWbCQa4htoKJQ1TU6yaI1GCNuxpvNJ950IbS4ampoplftfiKPPy1DAGi5loioK5V64hnUY6KAAqLON62FQFxT3oODJRFdeq87mBnznWESkwRi_9F0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL_sj8mAiaqHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

With regard to the top eight, we definitely consider it as our next challenge and we’ll definitely try and collect more points in the two home and two away matches. “You never know what will happen. We have the right to state that we are challenging for the top eight.”However, there isn’t a huge gap between Chippa and the four teams below them, which include Bloemfontein Celtic and Bidvest Wits.And Heric knows there are never guarantees for coaches at Chippa. The Serb is the third trainer to take charge of the Chilli Boys this season, having seen predecessors such as Teboho Moloi bite the dust at the slightest threat of relegation.He admitted, too, that the 3-0 scoreline against Chiefs was a bit flattering.Even though goals by Thabo Rakhale, Mxolisi Machupu and Edward Manqele were certainly enough, Amakhosi were unlucky not to score.Said Heric: “It could have gone differently had Chiefs scored first. But we took advantage. I’ve been around for 13 years, having spent a lot of time in the NFD. Whenever I work, I work like I’m coaching the best team in the league. “I believe I’ll get recognition as a coach one day, then perhaps go to greener pastures.”
