Blake got stronger as the race progressed, but he could not get anywhere near Simbine while Bruintjies held on for the biggest result of his career.It capped off a fantastic 24 hours for Team South Africa, who claimed nine medals on day five of competition. The attention will now turn to Anaso Jobodwana and Clarence Munyai, who will take part in their 200m heats on Tuesday.
