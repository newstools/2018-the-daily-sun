The Presidency on Friday announced that it had withdrawn leave to appeal the personal costs order made against former president Jacob Zuma in the state capture report review application.This withdrawal came alongside the Presidency's decision to also withdraw its application for leave to appeal the judgment of the North Gauteng High Court, said Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko."The Commission of Inquiry [into state capture] has now been established and started its work. No purpose is therefore served in the President pursuing the application," said Diko on Friday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvNIVId4XPjw-UdQBmhZoW7OIEGyWQy2OIEAe5yB5-FEq2bBC7Kq0XM6qGN9Rzjev_dyPbGc1lQFeTS6A7J0Att7aXfwhor1IAg6LCHK2YsVesfQFUOgZ7op8iqkwivxTtNBlvz_w_Ys6EoXefyof5UM1eUxx-JIY41Gio6gJi3PIJKEn5kMtbb3pmuozVYq7cmKPNVaausJlSYfzEUmdGMfvP4vU7wJRY6Y6BOF1YqDqfNUDanLy7b4WsX1aFaUkXjH6gsnVtgL7VBc4_x--1alP0SmRx-\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGTySNvhpj9gEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
