He apparently asked her to fetch Busisiwe.“My mother told him to come to the house so they could talk,” she said. Phindile said her sister moved back home after a meeting was held. “On Thursday night, we called him and asked him to bring the children’s clothes,”she said. “We were preparing to go to church.“When he arrived, he asked to speak to my sister but she refused. She said that, following Busisiwe’s death, they found a diary in which she poured her heart out. “We’re hurt because she couldn’t share her pain with us and now she’s dead,” she said. “They seemed happy together. We don’t know what might have triggered this. We are so sad,” said a member of the church the couple belonged to.
