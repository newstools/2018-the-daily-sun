The 2016-17 Diski champions vowed to reclaim the glory in the Diski Shield, which is set to kick off tomorrow and end on 5 May. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuS04waPdLsOjBiCwzxh_emfnsV2GtwW6i0D-BqvfYcCMEJmeBkdi90nrCCDTfBq-cn1TGNWsU1qzfqN0fkr0kxP25BauWdLLtU41Do3pveiUUzvHgsfAHecqTn-jkncaFxTGat4yZXs77xX0xEezEV2y_xq0z9DAlZWrgLLOscNI-SNJ6kRHmOyjcz4FoZgtJ22bMliFmjEWCNexzGempkjtg8RlLi8LgfN8U6FYcPi2iFAIvg2Lv6gj-QQB_G6Sh67eO6K3MvEXq0RcHn3SIXtw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI076BCXVEC2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But he remains adamant they will find their way to the final. “This is an opportunity for us to get something. The youngsters did well in the league, but this cup will be tougher for them. “They will be playing without the seniors who assisted them in the MDC.” The inaugural competition, launched last month, groups the 16 clubs into four regional pools, a Central, Coastal West, Coastal East and Northern pool. In the first round of the tournament, clubs will play each other once and the club with the most points at the end of the pool stages will progress to the semifinals. Sundowns are in the Northern Pool which includes rivals SuperSport United, Polokwane City and Baroka FC.
