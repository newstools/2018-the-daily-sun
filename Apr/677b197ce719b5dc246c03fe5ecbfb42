A NATIONAL reading campaign has added two languages to its literacy programme. Setswana and Xitsonga readers can now enjoy Nal’ibali supplements in their home language. The addition brings the campaign’s language supplements to eight. Gezani Chabalala, the campaign’s Xitsonga editor, said: “The preservation and promotion of indigenous languages is important. “Language, culture and identity are inseparable. They complement each other. “Language helps shape culture. As a minority in South Africa, it is important that we safeguard our language. “Xitsonga speakers will benefit from this milestone. “People learn better when lessons are conducted in a language they understand well.” Opelo Thole, the campaign’s Setswana editor, said she was grateful to Nal’ibali. “I would like to commend the campaign for giving Batswana children – and kids who speak other languages – the opportunity to read interesting stories in their mother tongue. It is a huge step towards ensuring we create a culture of reading with our children. At the same time, we will also be preserving our language,” said Thole. “Children who can read and write in their mother tongue can easily learn other languages. “Our language and culture will be promoted through storytelling. “The campaign also urges children to interact with others, use their imagination and learn from these stories.”
