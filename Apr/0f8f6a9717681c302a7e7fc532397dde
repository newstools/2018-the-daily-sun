The chances we receive, we have to defend well."We have 90 minutes and anything can happen. All we are going to do is try."We have 90 minutes plus extra time and what we have shown this year - even in the last game - is we can create a lot of chances in the last few minutes."Asked whether his side's mental state had been impacted by two defeats in the past week, Guardiola said: "I don't know."But, if we are not able to cope with that psychologically, it will be a good lesson for the future."It is a test. Football, like life, is a challenge."
