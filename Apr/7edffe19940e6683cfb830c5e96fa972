Life at Konyaspor hasn’t been rosy for the Bafana Bafana midfielder, who has become disillusioned with life in the Turkish Super Lig.The 27-year-old will be seeking a move elsewhere next season if his situation doesn’t improve.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvGATDDLkTDTRU0oPnOIdglQWoaH5ndqDy1JsGIFEfPoonjQO5pnUlAzIzDptyeJm7YX6nA8_F4L3EMsPIknNj4_p-zDKqh1n2h_Y4iJqgITGucsGq6aGti2deJmidN45yejbF-RWINurKRmIKq3DscfspGvaW-qEV0j_Fnxj9zItuY7nGahHrfrjl6teGlK6aklLfkT3nd-rgT8wzVCVocPYaXu-T2D9z1hjdfESEKksr7F9WN7JdYTtdLXcAKFvYvP3rKSRap4LrB-FKG\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK8LTdwFZUZfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But at the end of the season we will have to sit down and assess the situation,” said Manyama. “It’s up to the club to decide. But I want to play football. It doesn’t matter where. “Next season I want to play football. If I get a chance to fight for my place here, I will take it.“I played one game, scored two goals, got an assist, and was Man of the Match. The very next one I was on the bench. I don’t even warm up . . .” The constant changing of coaches hasn’t helped his situation, limiting his chances of fighting for his place in a fair fashion. “I believe the game is the end product of how you train. I train really well, I just can’t influence team selection. When the coach who brought me here left, I knew it was going to be tough. “Such things happen. But you want to play week in and week out. Although it hurts I have to keep hoping for the best.”Meanwhile, Bongani Zungu has hailed his Amiens FC teammates for the team’s improved performances. Zungu played as Amiens moved to 13th spot in the Ligue 1 table with a 3-0 win over Caen at the weekend. “We’ve always been three to four points behind teams in the top eight, and have never been worried about dropping into the relegation zone,” said Zungu.Lebo Mothiba bagged his second goal for Lille in Ligue 1, but they still went down 2-1 to Bordeaux. Keagan Dolly sat on the bench as Montpellier held Marseille 0-0. Lebogang Phiri suffered the same fate, as he was an unused substitute for Guingamp when they were thumped 4-0 at Troyes.
