Thembani’s father, Kamohelo Maya, said his daughter always told them she wanted to be an ambassador. Police spokesman Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said the driver lost control on a steep downhill.“Four passengers were rushed to MediClinic in Bethlehem. One was airlifted to Dihlabeng Hospital. Twelve were rushed to QwaQwa Hospital. One pupil was certified dead at the scene. All passengers in the taxi were school children,” he said. Free State Education spokesman Howard Ndaba sent condolences to the family. “We will take the affected pupils for counselling,” he said. “We call on all taxi owners and drivers to be extra careful when transporting school children.”
