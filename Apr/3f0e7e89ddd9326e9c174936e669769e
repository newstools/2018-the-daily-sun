THERE were screams of anger, terror and scenes of fighting. One could be fooled into thinking it was a Nollywood action movie. But the shocking video that has surfaced on the internet is from a school in KZN. Although no knives are seen in the video, police said one pupil was stabbed and is fighting for his life in hospital. The KZN Department of Education has sprung into action. It’s investigating apparent faction fighting between villages that has spilled over to Sakhelwe High School in Ezakheni, Ladysmith. It’s still not yet clear when the video was taken, but it was posted last Thursday. Allegations are that boys from a local school came to Sakhelwe and started the fight with the pupils, who then fought back. The 30-second clip shows a group of pupils throwing stones at the other group. One pupil is heard shouting in Zulu: “Bashaye!” This mean “Beat them up!” Education spokesman S’celo Khuzwayo confirmed the MEC was aware of the video. “The fight was apparently motivated by the faction fights that are going on in Ezakheni,” he said. He said such incidents affect teaching and learning. “We found out the fight started when a Sakhelwe boy asked a girlfriend of a boy from the other village to go out with him,” he said. “The boys became involved in a fight, and when their friends intervened it turned into a faction fight.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said Ezakheni detectives are investigating a case of assault. A 20-year-old pupil sustained injuries after being stabbed at a school. Cops bust four pupils aged between 17 and 21. They appeared in the Ezakheni Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The case was postponed to 3 May.
