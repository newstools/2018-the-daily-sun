FOR  one month, Jason couldn’t afford to pay his municipal water and electricity account. To save himself money, he decided he would only pay for the electricity portion of the account, and not the rest. A few months later, the municipality sent him a letter saying his electricity would be cut off if he didn’t pay the account. He thought they couldn’t do that and wanted to ignore the letter. Azikhiphi! That’s not on! You can’t just ignore official letters. Luckily, he called SCORPION LEGAL PROTECTION to find out what he should do. What can the municipality do? The municipality can switch off your electricity without a court order, if your account isn’t fully paid. You may not decide what portion thereof you want to pay. Although Jason paid his electricity bill, he didn’t pay the rest of the money he owed, and the municipality can cut his electricity. What about cutting off the water? The Constitution, along with Regulation 3 of the National Water Act 36 of 1998, states everyone should be provided with at least 25 litres of water per day. The municipality can’t disconnect your water, but they can disconnect your electricity, if your accounts haven’t been paid. What can Jason do? He’ll have to pay up his account. If his electricity has been cut off, he should contact the municipality. Jason should make payment in full, or he can enter into a credit agreement with the municipality. After making payment, he should request a reconnection. He may have to pay reconnection and call-out fees. How can Scorpion help Jason?
