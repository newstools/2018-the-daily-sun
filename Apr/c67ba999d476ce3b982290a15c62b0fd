Nkululeko said Sifiso and the owner made peace and Sifiso agreed to fix it.“But the cop came out of the tavern and shot him. Sifiso fell down. “We rushed him to hospital but he was certified dead on arrival.”The cop was arrested after handing himself over to his colleagues.Lerato said: “I am still shocked and cannot come to terms with the fact that he is gone. “He has left me with a five-month-old baby. I don’t know how I will raise our child alone.”Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that a police officer was arrested for murder. He said the docket was sent to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for further investigation. “The suspect is out on bail pending investigations,” Masondo said.
