Sifiso fell down. “We rushed him to hospital but he was certified dead on arrival.”The cop was arrested after handing himself over to his colleagues.Lerato said: “I am still shocked and cannot come to terms with the fact that he is gone. “He has left me with a five-month-old baby.

He said the docket was sent to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for further investigation. “The suspect is out on bail pending investigations,” Masondo said.
