Sometimes people make donations as a token of appreciation.” Odwa and Sinesipho are in matric. Usivile is in grade 10, and Xabiso is a college student.“We mostly practise on Saturdays. During the week we dedicate all our attention to our school work,” said Sinesipho.Masentle Masiteng (21), a member of the same church as the group, said: “When we are down, their dance routines lift our spirits.
