MEMORIES of the 6-0 massacre still linger for Orlando Pirates as they travel to Mbombela Stadium for their vital league fixture against SuperSport United.It was at the 2010 World Cup venue that the Buccaneers suffered one of the worst defeats in their history, going down to United last season.That loss had severe consequences for the Soweto giants as it not only prompted the abrupt resignation of coach Muhsin Ertugral, but also contributed to their embarrassing failure to quality for the MTN8 competition.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuWPf9kkkjU7XUSpQTIymlpc7duRuicaalLhw3Qn8N4cxy-Vo-eO1ZSx-bqqMBw8Q6AkMaAioANJu_XJMkYPffti6GkDBQFD_UFyuGzit05kd2nDPs7jyijj8gwGRDRme1PE91O8klKhBlLLA5Q6BBcE_DkGFg2gJWvNnCvuI8S6J4hW5JFefY6hOYtj2AB6o5_np-F6ocXxV0dVWEPz_EwGP_I0nZ-kNFAb4PbgblvYUfzfktw4Wo1ye10RBnWYJ1e_6H9YmWtQRfh_-jgWQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFuu2xwr664aEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It won’t be any different against SuperSport United,” said Sredojevic.“We know very well that with five games still to play this season, anything can happen. This is a crucial part of the season.”
