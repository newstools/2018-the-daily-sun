MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has hit out at SuperSport football analysts who he claims have a campaign against him to not be named as the Absa Premiership Coach of the Year. Masandawana were held to a 2-2 draw by an impressive Maritzburg united side in a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday evening. Speaking after the game Mosimane nominated counterpart Fadlu Davids as this season's coach of the year while at the same time hitting out at his own critics. "Fadlu is a very, very good coach," Mosimane said. "He's my candidate to win the coach of the year, not the cheerleaders in your [SuperSport 4] studio who are unbelievable and are punting against me." Asked to clarify his comments Mosimane confirmed: "I know they do it against me, anything against me then it's okay but I can just say match my record at Sundowns. "They don't want me to win it, but I can give it to him [Davids] so they don't have to punt it. Most especially Farouk Khan he's conflicted, he's on the panel so why is he speaking about it. "That's my opinion and I have a right to say it. He doesn't have to respond, pull the clip when him and Robert [Marawa] were speaking about it, it's there you've got it in your archives. Mosimane whose side are three points away from a record-extending eighth title signed off by saying: 'thank you to the haters'. -REUTERS
