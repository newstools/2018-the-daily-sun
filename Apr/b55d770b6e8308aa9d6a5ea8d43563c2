THE court was packed last week when six suspects accused of involvement in a ritual murder appeared in the Makuya Periodical Court. Hundreds of people tried to get into a court that only seats about 30 people. The angry crowd pushed forward against the barriers, with some of them saying: “We’re fed up with muthi murderers. “We want the police to set them free so we can teach them a lesson.” Gerson Mathoho (52), Eric Khobo (30), Rhulani Shirindi (43), Shonisani Muruge (53), Khuthadzo Tshidino (28) and Azwinndini Ndou (42) face murder charges. Mercy Ndou’s life was cut short by the sharp blades of ruthless body parts merchants four years ago. Ndou (33) from Shayandima Village in Limpopo disappeared in 2014 after telling her family she was visiting a relative. That was the last time she was seen alive.  Some of her body parts are still missing. Traditional healer Vusiwana Baloyi was sentenced to life in prison for her murder and five years for robbery. During trial in 2016, the evil Baloyi mentioned names of other people who allegedly took part in the killing. It took police almost two years to act on the information. The prosecutor said they could not continue with the bail application because a  suspect has to be arrested and evidence needs to be collected. The case was postponed to 9 May.
