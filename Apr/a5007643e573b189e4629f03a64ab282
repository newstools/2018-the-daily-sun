That means if I could leave a million rand in my car, they could take it. “All I want is for them to admit they’ve employed thieves and come up with a solution to my problem.“Maybe, I’m not the only one who has experienced such in their premises. “A wealthy company willing to be dented for a mere thousand rand by protecting shady staffers sucks.” The SunTeam then sought comment from Kia Motors services department manager Jason Quaroni. Said Jason: “The situation is unfortunate, but we’ll investigate this incident, but that’s not what Kia is about. We’ll revert back to Zuluboy.” Meanwhile, Zuluboy was involved in a car crash with a taxi at Newlands, KwaZulu-Natal, on Saturday. Witnesses said the taxi crashed into Zuluboy’s stationary car and the driver tried to run away from the scene. “I don’t know if it’s a bad omen following me around. The taxi’s owner isn’t co-operative at all,” Zuluboy said.
