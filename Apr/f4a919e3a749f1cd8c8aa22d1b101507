While the world and the dance music scene in particular have lost one of the finest talents with the death of Swedish DJ Avicii, Black Coffee has lost a brother. The Mzansi DJ has been flying the country’s flag high on the international stage for some time now and he has had the opportunity to rub shoulders with the world’s best DJ’s including the now late Avicii. Black Coffee took to social media to share some of the last WhatsApp conversations he had with the Swedish DJ before he died where they talked about Gqom music. "Life is fragile....Just last week I was chatting with you and @shaunduvet about working together, excited about being inspired by your recent visit in South Africa. Thank you for sharing your gift with us legend. Death be not proud," Black Coffee wrote. Avicii , whose real name is Tim Bergling, was found dead on Friday afternoon in Oman with exact details surrounding his yet to be communicated to the media and public.
