Spiering walked up and gave her a piece of paper with his name and phone number
on it. She said it was only fitting that they married in the aisle where they
met.The couple said they picked April 1, which was
Easter Sunday, because it was close to two other important dates: Spiering
celebrates his birthday on April 2, Smith on April 3.The judge who performed the ceremony said it was
his first wedding at a grocery store. Store owner George Thimons said he was
glad to accommodate the couple.Smith said after the ceremony the wedding was just
what they wanted, "something nice and easy.SOURCE: NEWS24
