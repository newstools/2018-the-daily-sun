The City’s objective was also to raise awareness of services available to older persons. The events included bowling, basketball, duck walking, brisk walking, wheelchair pegging and French boules. Smith, the social development MMC, said: “We had also partnered with numerous other organisations such as the health department, who assisted with health screening and related advice.  “There was also a focus on socioeconomic aspects that impact on the lives of our older persons,” he said. Eighty volunteers from False Bay TVET College helped the 340 clubs that took part in the games.  “The event is getting more and more popular every year and the City hopes to increase it in size next year,” said Smith. There was also live entertainment.
