A cash van was hit in kleksdorp in North West on Thursday and the community gathered to collect the leftover money. In the first Video, thugs are seen carrying rifles while others are loading bags of money into a double cab bakkie parked along the cash van. The bakkie then drives away and a few minutes later, a number people are seen surrounding the money truck parked in the middle of an intersection. They appear to be helping themselves to the cash. They are then seen running away from the truck as the authorities approach.
