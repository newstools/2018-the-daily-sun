THE eight-year-old was allegedly beaten with a sjambok for losing a pen at school. The girl and her 10-year-old brother then reported their aunt to their local cop shop on Wednesday on their way to school. The girl’s father (47) from Batho in Mangaung, Free State said his kids’ mum died two years ago and the family asked the aunt on her side to take care of the children. “I lived with the mother of my two kids for years but after her death, her family chased me away,” he said. “Since my kids have been living with their aunt, they complain that she beats them for nothing and refuses to let them play with other kids.” He said the boy told him the aunt once hanged him from a rope. “I tried to get them to live with me but the family refused as I never married their mum.” He said his daughter asked the aunt to buy her a pen but the woman attacked her. “I want my kids back and I will fight for them. “I’m going to go to court if they refuse to let my children live with me. I want the aunt behind bars. My daughter did not deserve this.” A family spokeswoman said when she heard the story and saw the bruises on the child, she went to the aunt’s home. “I wanted to kill her. “I wanted her to feel the pain that innocent child felt but cops rescued her by arresting her.” Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said an assault case was opened against the 55- year-old suspect, who appeared in court on Friday and still is in custody.
