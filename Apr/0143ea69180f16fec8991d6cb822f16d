TWO buyers and two sellers were caught in possession of copper cables worth R1,5 million! The four were arrested in Wynberg, Joburg on Thursday. This was after members of the public alerted the police to some dodgy dealings at a scrapyard in the area. JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the cables belonged to the City of Joburg. “JMPD arrested four men during Operation Buya Mthetho for possession of stolen copper cable at a scrapyard in Wynberg. Officers received a tip-off and upon investigation found copper cable valued at about R1,5 million. “Two of the men were selling the cable, while the other two work at the scrapyard. “They have been charged with theft and possession of stolen goods.” Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba congratulated the officers for a job well done. He also called for Operation Buya Mthetho to be intensified.
