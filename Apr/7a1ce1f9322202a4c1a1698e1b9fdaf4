The federation handed over a memorandum of grievances to Eric Phindela, parliament’s acting deputy secretary. Meanwhile, Cosatu picketed outside parliament over the same issues. Cosatu general secretary Tony Ehrenreich said: “The VAT increase will have a devastating effect on the poor.”Ehrenreich said Cosatu supported the proposed minimum wage. “It will address the worst forms of exploitation,” he said.“However, we will be demanding a living wage to ensure that workers have enough money to look after their families.”
