WHEN cattle herder Sevens Chiloane heard his livestock mooing while drinking water, he ran to see what was going on. And he was shocked to find a two-metre crocodile floating dead in the water! The 37-year-old said the incident happened at the Edinburgh Dam, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, yesterday. He said the creature was just lying in the water of the dam, which is drying up. “It wasn’t moving. I called other cattle herders to help me pull it out of the water. I feared the lives of animals and residents would be in danger if it contaminated the water with its poisonous brain,” said Sevens. Worried madala Tonic Godi (64) said cattle and goats as well as wild animals like hippos were in danger as the dam was drying up because of the drought. “All our animals from Rolle and Songeni drink here but I fear this dam is drying up,” he said. “Everything is dying, including crocodiles and hippos. The dam supplies us with water, as well as nearby villagers, but now the water plant and the taps are dry.” Mpumalanga Tourism Parks spokeswoman Kholofelo Nkambule said a team was sent to investigate and remove the dead crocodile. She said at this stage, they couldn’t tell what had killed the reptile.
