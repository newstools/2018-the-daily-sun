And she is still waiting for an RDP!Noguthela, from Mzi- nti Village near Malelane in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun her application for an RDP house was approved 10 years ago. But it was later removed from the system and she was told she “might die at any time” and so she did not deserve a house.She said she walks every morning to exercise and she eats healthy meals. “I am still alive and kicking even though they denied me a house 10 years ago.”The gogo said the matter was reported to the department, but no one came to investigate.“Instead they accused me of wanting a second house, saying mine was approved and I was the owner.“I believe I will live until I get my RDP house.”A spokesman for the department, Freddy Ngobe, said: “There is no way that a beneficiary gets to be approved and is then removed from the system, especially when all requirements have been met.“We will establish the exact facts around this matter,” he promised.
