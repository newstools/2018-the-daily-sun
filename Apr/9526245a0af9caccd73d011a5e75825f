Stress can lead to many illnesses such as high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes and depression. Doctors, teachers and police are more prone to stress so that’s why Ekurhuleni North department has organised gym sessions, which take place four times a year. The last one happened at Mehlareng Stadium in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni on Friday. Molaba Motsobane from the district said the sessions provide an opportunity for teachers to interact with people in other professions. “They learn new thing and about people’s cultures by interacting with them,” he said. Molaba said the free gym is the answer for people who suffer from various illness, as well as those who want to keep fit. Reuben Maila, Ivory Park Community Learning Centre manager, said: “Every profession is stressful. “Aerobics is a good way to have healthy minds and keep stress away especially for us as teachers.” Maria Mothapo, a representative of the Tembisa Community Learning Centre, said teachers from various schools in Tembisa welcomed the sessions. “They are happy. Most of the people who come here are women and the department has urged men to also take part in the sessions. “Healthy people contribute positively to the production of everything they do,” she said. Fitness trainer Happy Mnisi from Moreko Gym said he was invited to train people and encouraged people to join his gym. Noxolo Dipholo from Virgin Active said exercise was the foundation of good health. “I was asked to assist in training the teachers,” she said.
