After two days the stitches came apart and formed two big holes that oozed pus. She told Daily Sun that when the stitches ripped open she went to the KwaMashu Clinic but was told the wound would heal soon. Her tummy started swelling up and a bigger hole started forming.Her brother Bonga Gwala (34) said: “After Daily Sun contacted the health department, the hospital called her. “They did blood tests and told her to return after three months.”Nompendulo’s family took her to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital last Monday. She was coughing and had hiccups.“She was very weak when they admitted her,” he said. “On Sunday they called to inform me they were transferring her to King Edward Hospital. She had another illness.“They said they would put her on a life support machine.” He said when they went to visit her on Tuesday, they discovered she had died the previous night. “We asked for a post mortem to be performed so we could determine the cause of death.”KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: The department is unable to respond to the questions raised.“The patient’s next of kin are urged to communicate with the hospital through the office of the public relations manager. “This will help them gain access to information which may provide clarity regarding the circumstances of the patient’s death.”
