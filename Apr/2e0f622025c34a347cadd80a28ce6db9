On Wednesday, all the speakers at the event praised Mama Winnie.They said she was a brave woman who stood up for what she believed in. “To us, having an opportunity to work at a clinic which was named after one of the most respected women in the world means a lot. “We will always remember what she did to help our country for as long as we live.” Clinic manager Sello Moletsane told Daily Sun that after the 1994 elections, residents decided to name the clinic after Winnie Mandela to honour her while she was still alive. “We knew she had taken part in the freedom struggle and believed it was right to name the clinic after her so her name would always live on among us and future generations,” said Makhotso.
