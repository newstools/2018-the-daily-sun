KAIZER Chiefs will end a third season in a row without winning a silverware after they were booted out of the Nedbank Cup on Saturday night. Free State Stars ended Amakhosi dream of reaching Nedbank Cup final when they defeated them 2-0 at Moses Mabhida Stadium to book a spot in the final of the competition which is scheduled for 19 May in Cape Town, Cape Town Stadium. Stars wasted no chance as they showed their intentions in the first minutes of the match when Stars man of the moment Harris Tchilimbou finds the back of the net within 45 seconds in the match. Tchilimbou completed his brace in the 35th minutes which ensured stars go to their first final since 1999. Chiefs costly defensive errors were one of the main reason why the Soweto giants could not reach the final of the Ke Yona competition. In the last 15 minutes of the match Chiefs fans started throwing objects to Steve Komphela's bench and that saw a police car being driven onto the side of the field to protect Chiefs bench. After the final whistle things escalated from bad to worse when the fans invaded the pitch, beating security guards and the players ran for their lives to the tunnel. Stars will be playing their first final competition since 1999. Ea Lla Koto last played a final in 1999 when they lost to Mamelodi Sundown in the Rothmans Cup, they also lost in the 1994 Bob Save Super Bowl to Vaal Professionals, just months after their only major trophy success when they beat Hellenic to take the Coca-Cola Cup now known as the Telkom Knockout.
