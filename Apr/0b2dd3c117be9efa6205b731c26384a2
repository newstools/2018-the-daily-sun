They’re now looking for a record label that will help them fulfil their dream to record and release an album. Thando said their ultimate goal is to have their own record label, but they still have a long way to go.“We see how people get robbed when signing contracts with some companies, and we don’t want that to happen to us,” he said. They’d like to release an album before December. “We have demos, and if anyone can help us we’d appreciate it,” he said. Thando said they sing about everything: love, family and God. “We have songs about how our mothers raised us and we have gospel songs. We practise three times a week and sometimes longer if we have a gig,” he said. Sibusiso said they started singing to make money, but realised people enjoyed watching them sing. They empressed the crowd when they performed at the Boxing SA Awards in Port Elizabeth in February.“The response we get from people is overwhelming and motivates us to grow stronger. Our goal is to see the youth quit doing things that could cut their lives short.” They’d like to work with jazz singer Sibongile Khumalo and kwaito singer DJ Tira.
