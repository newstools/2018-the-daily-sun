OVER 23 people who were involved in violent protests in
Mahikeng, will appear in the Mmabatho Magistrates’ Court on Monday. The nine suspects were arrested on Friday, for attempting to
burn properties following three days of violent protests in Mahikeng and
surrounding villages. " They will appear together with 14 other suspects that
were arrested between Thursday and Friday. Police are maintaining their
presence in the area to ensure that the situation is stabilised,” said
Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane. According to Motswenyane, in the first incident, a petrol
bomb that caused minor damages, was thrown at a house belonging to a traffic
official in Magogwe Tar village. " In a separate incident, a petrol bomb that was
apparently meant to cause fire and damages to Mmabana Foundation building
failed. This is the same building that was burnt on Thursday,” said Motswenyane. A relatively calm situation has prevailed after President
Cyril Ramaphosa visited the town on Friday. The President cut his working visit to London, United
Kingdom, short because of protest action that brought the city to a standstill. The President was locked in a meeting with government and
political party leaders all of Friday afternoon. The President promised the residents of Mahikeng that their
concerns would be dealt with speedily following consultation with community
members across the province.
