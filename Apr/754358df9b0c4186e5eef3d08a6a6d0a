Then we used to live in a four-roomed house in Lotus Gardens and I worked as a cleaner at the cop shop,” said Mary.“But my son’s condition became worse over the years and I was forced to resign from work to look after him.” Then in 2008 tragedy struck when her house burnt down after a burning candle fell. Since then they have been living in rented rooms. She said her son’s disability grant doesn’t last the whole month.Mbangwa Xaba, a spokesman for the Gauteng Social Development Department, said social workers would be sent to assess the family’s situation.
