Mamelodi Erf 29355, Thorntree View and the Rama City Human Settlements Project launched by the Premier in the north-western part of the city near Rosslyn. Upon completion, Rama City will yield more than 15 000 units. In Ga-Rankuwa Ext 10, a new contractor was appointed in February to revisit the existing incomplete infrastructure that has been vandalized over a period of three years. MOOIPLAATS Gauteng Department of Housing and Human Settlements, we reported that 350 of the 841 approved beneficiaries will be moved from Mooiplaats to Olivenhoutbosch extension 27. The relocation is necessary because Mooiplaats is dolomitic and only a fraction of the land is habitable. The city is in the process of identifying other suitable pieces of land to relocate the remainder of the qualifying households to. LAND INVASION AS such we encourage our people to not allow themselves to be used as political pawns to further the agendas of political parties who do not always have their best interests at heart. This was demonstrated most recently in Olievenhoutbosch where land parcels were unlawfully seized on the undue encouragement of a councillor in the area. This was done in defiance of the prescripts of section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic, and indeed does not speed up property ownership but rather delays and aggravates a backlog dating back as far as the advent of democracy in South Africa. This is why our approach seeks to make people real homeowners, and protects their right to build assets and wealth over time and hand these over to their children.
