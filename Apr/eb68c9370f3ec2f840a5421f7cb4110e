“I CAN stop this evil spirit,” claims prophet Israel Ramakokobo (47) from Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane. He said his five-year-old son Ishmael saw a vision about Mashilo-Matsho Primary School. Daily Sun published a shocking story about the school on 15 March after parents called the paper asking for help. They said their kids rolled on the ground, waved their arms around, and twisted like snakes while screaming. The parents believe they’re possessed by evil spirits. Israel claimed the school is haunted by a spirit of a pupil who isn’t resting in peace. “The parents made it worse by taking their children to different sangomas,” he said. He said he believed that after performing a ritual at the school, the pupils will be normal again. Israel said he went to the school last week to provide help. “But the principal said I needed to get permission from the district and they would give me a date to visit the school,” he said. Daily Sun visited the school on Friday and the situation had not changed. The parents said they wanted learning and teaching to resume. North West Education spokesman Elias Malindi said the department had reached out to religious leaders and parents. “We’ve invited clinical experts to offer psychological care to teachers and pupils,” he said.
