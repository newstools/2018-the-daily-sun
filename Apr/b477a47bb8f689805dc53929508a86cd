BONGUMENZI Mkhize has been missing since last month. The 16-year-old from Umkhunya Village in Ixopo, in the KZN Midlands was last seen on 31 March when he went to fetch cattle in the nearby bush. His mum, Bancengile Mkhize (50), told Daily Sun her son had gone to fetch two family cows from the bush on the day he disappeared. “Bongumenzi first brought home five cows. “He then told us he was going back to fetch two more cattle after he couldn’t find them earlier,” said Bancengile. She said what makes them suspect there’s something wrong about Bongumenzi’s disappearance is that he always used to tell them where he was. “Even if he was going to a neighbour’s house, which is five minutes away, he would inform us.” Bancengile said they’ve called all their relatives and Bongumenzi’s friends but no one had seen him. “It’s strange because the bush is not even far from our home and the two cows had since been found, but not Bongumenzi.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cops were investigating. “Police are appealing to anyone who may know the whereabouts of the teenager or who has seen him to contact Sergeant Pretty Maphumulo on 071 7400 527 or 039 834 1013. “People can also call 08600 10111 or their nearest police station.”
