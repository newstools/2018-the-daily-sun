BOX clever, outwit your opponent and maintain fitness. SuperSport United interim coach Kaitano Tembo sounds more like a boxing trainer when he talks about the tough matches still ahead. Pinned to the ropes, United are not only fighting to save their PSL status but also looking to kick-start their Caf Confederation Cup campaign. These are the challenges caretaker Tembo faces as he tries to impress his bosses and prove his credentials as the right man for the job in the long term. Matsatsantsa a Pitori host Gor Mahia in the second leg of their play-off tie at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (7pm). Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, the Tshwane outfit needs nothing less than victory to progress in the cup competition. But they are certainly not as desperate for victory in Africa as they are in the domestic league. “We took a relatively young team there for the first leg. Because of our situation we have to box clever, try and manage our squad properly so that we always have fresh legs when we play our next match,” said Tembo. “We played youngsters Luke le Roux, Jamie Webber, Sipho Mbule and Thuso Phala as a striker. And we played well. They (Mahia) got a dubious last-minute penalty. But we can’t really complain about playing in Africa. “We’re used to it. We just need to focus on the next game. We have an obligation to put up a strong team that will perform as the club requires.” United are third from bottom with 29 points in the Absa Premiership, having drawn their last two league games. Free State Stars visit them next week. At this stage, priority seems to be the league, although every game matters to Tembo. He added: “Mahia have the advantage, leading 1-0. But we need to go out there, score goals and make sure we give nothing away. They’ll probably sit back. There’s no need for them to rush.”
