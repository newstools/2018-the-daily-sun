 Four people were killed and another critically injured following a head-on collision on the R25 near Bronkhorstspruit. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon. ER24 paramedics, along with the Provincial Services, arrived on the scene shortly after 16h00 to find one light motor vehicle in the emergency lane while another was found on the side of the road. Both vehicles had burst into flame and were well alight. "Fire services began to fight the fire and extinguish the blaze in a few short minutes. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered three bodies in the one vehicle while another body was found in the second vehicle. Unfortunately, all four patients had already succumbed to their numerous burn wounds. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead," said ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring. Paramedics treated the woman and provided her with advanced life support interventions before she was airlifted by the ER24 Oneplan Helicopter to Sunshine hospital. The exact details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
