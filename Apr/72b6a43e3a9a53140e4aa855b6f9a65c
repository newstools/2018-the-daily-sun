Our hands have got to be one of the most important body parts to take care of. We do so much with our hands. We eat with our hands, work with our hands and shake other people’s hands. We constantly expose our hands so it’s vital that we take good care of our hands. Here are five simple tips to care for your hands.   1.	Wash your hands regularly We were all taught from a very young age that it’s important to wash your hands. Wash your hands with soap before eating every meal, after you go to the bathroom and whenever your hands are dirty. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>2.	Apply hand cream regularly The skin on your hands is not as firm and tough as the skin on the rest of your body. This skin is a lot more exposed to the elements (wind, sun and water) and that can cause the skin to get easily dry. Also once your hands have been exposed to soap and water from washing them, cause hands to be dry too. Apply a moisturizing hand cream to dry hands and to prevent dry hands. 3.	Wear gloves when you’re busy with house chores When working on chores such as washing the dishes, mopping the floor and cleaning the garden. These activities can be harmful for our hands because your hands get dirty and are exposed to all kinds of different germs and also the harsh chemicals we use to clean our homes can be harmful for our hands. Always wear gloves to protect your hands. 4.	Cut, file and clean your nails Self care is so important. Many people take care of their hair and face but neglect their hands. Make sure to regularly cut and file your finger nails to look neat, also clean out the dirt that gets stuck under the nails daily. 5.	Exfoliate your hands If you apply all the above mentioned tips of taking care of your hands regularly, you will have nice, healthy, soft, good looking hands. But, if you want to be extra, exfoliate your hands. Exfoliation is good to remove dead skin cells on our skin. Exfoliating your hands will do the exact same thing. Exfoliate your hands using any aqueous cream mixed with sugar, or use olive oil mixed with sugar. Mix the ingredients well and rub all over your hands gently in circular motions. Do this at least once a month.
