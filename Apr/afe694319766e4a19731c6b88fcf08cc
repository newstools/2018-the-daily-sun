They are coming here to fight for three points at all cost and we also want to do the same. That is why I am saying this is going to be the toughest game for us this season.”But Molekwa is confident his boys are ready to face the challenge from the Pretoria-based side.“The break has been good for us since we managed to work on our weaknesses, and I can see that we will be a different team on Wednesday,” he added. “We have prepared well and I am optimistic that we can get the points and move away from the position we are on. We are playing at home and we should also take advantage. But I see a tough clash and entertaining to the fans.” United interim coach, Kaitano Tembo, agreed with Molekwa that all their remaining six league matches are not easy. “We are fighting for the same thing like Polokwane, which is to move away from the position we are on. But these are games that we need to show our quality, and character. "I know it’s also not easy to play under this situation because of pressure from the boys. But we have done all we can to prepare and can only hoping to come back from Polokwane with all three points.”   Absa Premiership fixturesTuesdayAmaZulu FC v Ajax Cape Town King Zwelithini Stadium Bidvest Wits v Maritzburg United Bidvest Stadium WednesdayPlatinum Stars v Baroka FC Royal Bafokeng Stadium Polokwane City v SuperSport United Old Peter Mokaba Stadium Free State Stars v Kaizer Chiefs Goble Park Cape Town City FC v Golden Arrows Cape Town StadiumMamelodi Sundowns v Chippa United Loftus Versfeld Stadium  Orlando Pirates v Bloemfontein Celtic Orlando StadiumAll the matches kick off at 7.30pmAbsa Premiership Log Stadings
