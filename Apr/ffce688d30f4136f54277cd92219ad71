PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) chairman Irvin Khoza said action will be taken to stop the increasing criminality in highly supported matches. Adressing the media on Monday following the fan violence that occurred at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday, Khoza insisted that a strong message must be sent to deal with this trend that is destroying the fibre of our nation. Kaizer Chiefs suffered a 2-0 defeat against Free State Stars in their Nedbank Cup semi-final, following which hundreds of supporters stormed into the field of play after the final whistle. Stadium property and broadcasting equipment was damaged and several security guards were hospitalised. Under-fire Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela resigned after the match ending his three year throphy less spell with the club. This was not the first such incident in little over a year after Orlando Pirates supporters took to the field of play during their 6-0 defeat against Mamelodi Sundowns in February 2017. Nine months ago, two soccer supporters were killed in a stampede at FNB Stadium during the Soweto derby clash between Chiefs and Pirates. "The league is extremely shocked at the violence that took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday night. I want to make it clear that there is no place for violence in our stadiums and society," Khoza said. "We apologise to all the stakeholders and broadcasters for the damage caused to their property. The pictures of the pitch invasion in the media are not good for the image of our local football. â€œThere will be a thorough investigation. We also note the upward trend of increasing violence at stadiums." "The league held a meeting and noted the increasing criminality especially at highly-supported matches and a strong message must be sent to deal with this trend. It cannot be allowed to continue."
