AfriForum says it wants to pursue private prosecution
against EFF leader Julius Malema on charges of fraud and corruption. Afriforum said the matter relates to Malema's Ratanang
Family Trust which allegedly benefited
from the irregular awarding of a R52 million tender to On Point Engineering in
Limpopo. Afriforum's advocate Gerrie Nel told the briefing on Thursday that the National Prosecuting Authority said the case
has already been transferred to the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit which is
reconsidering re-instating charges against Malema. The matter was struck off the roll in 2015.
