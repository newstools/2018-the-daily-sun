I could sue the health department, but I will not. I just want my job back.” Mashadi said the matter had a negative effect on her. She almost lost her house last year.Congress of South African Trade Unions deputy secretary-general Solly Phetoe called for the clinic to reinstate Mashidi immediately. He said the matter should have been handled differently.Provincial health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said: “Unfortunately she agreed to the dismissal, filed for pension payout and only appealed more than a year later.“The matter is still in the office of the MEC and it has been finalised. The result will be communicated to the relevant parties.“We do not know the outcome of the appeal at this stage.”
