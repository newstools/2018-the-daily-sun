MPUMI MAVI’s son Mpilo, like any other six-year-old, is hyperactive, spirited and naughty.As a PR pro, his mum is doing her best for her wellbeing.Research shows that 1 in 5 (19%) of South African kids skip breakfast – that’s scary.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“But I know that eating breakfast has a positive effect on behaviour, memory and attention, alertness and problem-solving, so this is one meal I can’t allow him to miss,” says Mavi. “For breakfast, Mpilo enjoys cereal. Luckily, he’s at an age where he’s able to make it for himself, so he’ll prepare a bowl of cereal and yoghurt while I get ready for work.”Mpilo then heads off to school with his lunchbox, which usually consists of a sandwich and snacks like popcorn, fruit and yoghurt. He loves yoghurt – as long as it’s a smooth flavour and doesn’t contain any fruit bits.“I read a local study that said children who eat yoghurt are more likely to eat more fruit, whole grains, and have a lower calorie intake from fat and sugar, and are less likely to be overweight,” she said.“Mpilo is a sports fan. He plays cricket, soccer and anything else that involves being active and running around, which I love as kids these days sit in front of the TV way too much.“Most nights supper is fish or chicken with salad or the ‘dreaded’ veggies. We’ve reached a stage where Mpilo is starting to rebel against veggies though – cauliflower, broccoli and green beans seem to offend his taste buds.” But Mpilo’s dad and granny spoil him rotten.“This shows in the changes when he comes back from seeing them. He demands sugar on his cornflakes, for example, which he doesn’t get normally when he’s with me,” she said.Mavi has entered the 1 Million Moms Pledge For Healthy Change on Facebook on the KnowYourYoghurt page and wants to win.In it mums where they share tips on how to get kids to eat for a better health.
