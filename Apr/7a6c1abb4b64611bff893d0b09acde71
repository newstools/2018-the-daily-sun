THE KZN Health prayer day held at Addington Hospital in Durban was a much needed spiritual upliftment for departmental staff.This was voiced jointly by Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo and healthcare workers who attended the prayers on Monday. Dhlomo said they needed divine intervention following numerous tragic incidents which had claimed the lives of nurses and doctors over the past years. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstFEDTRACUc0rIkEBBweHlfrBUsXadySR4HTVLMcOMP1FWFM4coYl9aThYjGLP2nhQ1kq7o_wKOtSR4SvQRGTpOzfpMH3D0WfcYeIoRoUiqms4Wfz_x9nMXqtrVsDV3gqDeyMRcV-5vGnXD7F98GlwCuG2S7mC6pdJR_tWC6WTn0PA9FiuSeJxAdfaFEcUTNf95GJy0KBofs5wParWOpPKuSzyN7ND0aGkND3SHHADDmxmFvUwAtEiuhYB3vM_-T2UZqszlx7ObUKYZlDu2UEzzfCuYCqs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJAEcfcovSwvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said the pain that comes with the untimely deaths of health workers is seen when their passing is communicated to their families. “When we went to report the death of Sibusiso Ndileka in Cuba to his family, they all went out of the house screaming, leaving us all alone.“You could see that the pain was not bearable.” He said he can only imagine how difficult it is for the families and staff when a nurse or a doctor they have worked with closely dies a tragic death. Dr Nhlakanipho Gumede said they really needed the prayers because the sudden loss of a health worker leaves a huge hole in the department.“It’s common knowledge that South Africa has a shortage of doctors so losing a single doctor is a huge loss to the community because it cripples the system,” said Gumede.He said in 2011 he lost his friend, Dr Mvikeleni Khanyi, who died while driving from Newcastle Hospital to his home in Nongoma.Over the past few years, nearly 50 nurses and doctors have died untimely deaths. Some were killed in car accidents, some were shot or stabbed, while others committed suicide.
