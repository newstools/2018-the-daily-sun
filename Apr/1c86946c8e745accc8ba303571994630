South Africa's Chad le Clos claimed his third gold medal of the 2018 Commonwealth Games after winning the 100m butterfly on Monday. Le Clos won in a time of 50.65 - a new Commonwealth Games record - finishing ahead of England's James Guy (51.31) and Australia's Grant Irvine (51.50). The South African was just ahead at the 50m turn and looked like he might be fading, but he was strong in the second half of the race as he won comfortably in the end.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvTDV1d6D07VZep_fTCZ-D9-mnAXSiXGZwcViwhCSR79zxRE72o5YggxaUDWAySd3FUY-FrOjmwjoQdHjmW-LaoPCW0NCmxTnvkqz-pvyjEHf4-3vwQxqckZCoa1wUGDLHTEjICvk-03zErRedImn1iqzxecXi0VAskwvVe6poIeEZoDhnqYYR9KqiClP0MCp4-yCExqj3PHPaZ0Qvjw-Y5su4dMIr2q7MUo4bf2pdbo4mNpdBHiW_K-3Y4PnhgivlH9bhV93uuAkGTx0vI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGTTtfuhlWrOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
