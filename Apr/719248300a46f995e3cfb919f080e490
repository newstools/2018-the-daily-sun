RELEGATION threatened Absa Premiership clubs will need to avoid dropping points unnecessary in the remaining three league games to avoid the drop when the curtain goes down on 12 May. As things stand, five teams are in danger of being axed (Golden Arrows, Polokwane City, SuperSport United, Ajax Cape Town and Platinum Stars). All these teams will need as many points off their final league games in order to remain in the top flight. The team who finishes at the bottom of the table will be automatically relegated to National First Division (NFD), while the club that end their campaign in 15th spot will get another opportunity of fighting for their premiership status in the promotion/ relegation play-offs where they will be joined by two sides that finish second and third in the promotion/ relegation play-offs which are scheduled for May. Platinum Stars could even kiss their premiership status a goodbye with two games to go if it happens they lose their next match against AmaZulu and Ajax get maximum points against Baroka FC.
