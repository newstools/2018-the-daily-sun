Msimanga said the City’s finances were not only healthy but have improved since the DA-led coalition government took over after the 2016 local government elections. “The cash and equivalents at the end of the year improved from R1,1 billion in the 2015/16 financial year to R2,1 billion in 2016/17.”He announced that, because of the sale of the mayoral mansion last year for R5,1 million, about 40 poor families will get RDPs by June next year. “The project will also create work and benefit local families,” he said.Msimanga said the sewerage problems in Ga-Rankuwa were caused by incorrect pipes installed by the previous administration. “We will remove them and install proper ones,” he said.“The continued sewer problems were also caused by sabotage. “We’ve found objects in the pipes that show they have been placed there on purpose.” Msimanga said they have increased access to health service delivery. “Most of our clinics will be running seven days a week, 24 hours a day.“And we’ll make sure they have all the facilities and equipment to deal with emergencies.”
