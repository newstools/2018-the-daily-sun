It contains two images of Winnie: one when she was young, the other when she was older.“She showed that women, too, can fight. She also showed a woman does not have to be the shadow of her husband,” he said.The area was named after Winnie’s first name the day before the first democratic elections in 1994, when people were moved there from nearby Waterkloof Farm.Resident Nosethu Madlolo (59) said: “We were forced to leave our belongings and came here to an open space. There were only toilets and concrete basins.” Nosethu said houses were built in 1998.“They were supposed to be bigger, but we got single rooms. Some were forced to build shacks and are still living in them till this day.” Councillor Simthembile Mfecane said: “A lot still needs to be done to eradicate poverty in the area.”
