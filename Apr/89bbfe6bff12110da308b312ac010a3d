THE two thugs saw him coming and thought the young man would be an easy pushover. But they got much more than they bargained for. Monyaku Sefoka (22) from Midrand in Joburg fought like a lion and one of the thugs ended up in hospital under police guard. Unfortunately, the SunHero couldn’t get to the other thug as the man ran away with his mobile tablet. Monyaku said he was walking home from school on Thursday when he saw the two men seated some distance up the road, as if they were waiting for someone. “When I was passed them, they charged and attacked me. They searched my pockets,” he said. He said the two men eventually took his tablet and ran away. “I couldn’t let those thugs take my tablet just like. I chased them down the road “We fought over my tablet for about 30 minutes. One of them sprayed me with pepper spray and I couldn’t see at one point. “But I braved the pain to open my eyes and looked for a brick as they ran away from me. I chased after them, throwing the brick and I hit one of them. He fell down,” said Monyaku. He dragged the thug he’d knocked out to nearby security guards, who called the cops. Police arrived and took the suspect to hospital. He is under police guard. Monyaku said when he searched the bleeding thug, he couldn’t find his tablet. It seems the other one had disappeared with it. “Although I won half the battle I still feel defeated as I lost my tablet with my school work on it,” he said. Midrand police spokeswoman Constable Tlamela Matome said police arrested one suspect for theft. She said the suspect will appear in court soon and meanwhile the police are looking for the other suspect.
