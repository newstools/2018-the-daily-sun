LAND grabs left motorists stranded after roads were barricaded with burning tyres and stones on Wednesday night at Heidedal, in Mangaung. The gatvol residents occupied a piece of land during the day. They claimed that they were promised RDPs 10 years ago. The police arrived and fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse the angry crowd. A resident, Jan Mooi, told the SunTeam all they wanted was to be treated fairly by the municipality. “We’re not saying we want RDPs now. We just need land to build our shacks. “We are tired of living in our parents’ backyards. We won’t stop fighting for land. “If our demands are not met we will not stop fighting. “We will build shacks wherever we see open land,” said Jan. Mangaung municipal city manager Tankiso Mea arrived and addressed the angry crowd. He told the residents that he would meet the ward councillor and community representatives to plan a way forward. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said one man was arrested during the protest. “A 48-year-old man was arrested for public violence. He will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon. “Our members are still in the area to monitor the situation.”
