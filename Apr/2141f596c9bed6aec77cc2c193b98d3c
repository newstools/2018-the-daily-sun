He plans to sponsor the foundation with a bus to transport its members to Gabisile Shabane’s funeral in Mpumalanga. The 13-year-old was kidnapped and killed in the province last month. “It is my wish to lend a helping hand, including office equipment and a car that will make it easier for you to move around whenever you fight for the rights of people with albinism,” the church leader said. The foundation’s Andile “MC Pholobas” Ngcobo said he was grateful for the warm welcome. He said they were hopeful the leader’s prayer would bring change to their lives. “We came here because we believe that kneeling before the king will bring us a blessing.” He said they also believed that if they came to the church, they would be protected as they believe in churchgoers’ kindness.“I take public transport when I go around fighting issues. Getting a car to do this job is indeed a bonus,” said Ngcobo.
