Resident Justice Ndlovu (52) said: “We’re having a hard time with the clinic and our complaints fall on deaf ears. “When we come to the clinic, sometimes there are no lights. “Sometimes they run out of medication and tell us to buy it elsewhere.” Justice said patients struggle to get their files as some of the nurses are rude. “We complained about the poor service two years ago, but nothing has changed,” he said. But Gauteng Health spokesman Lesemang Matuka insisted there is a generator at the clinic for in case there is a power failure. “According to facility management, there has been no power failure in the past six months,” Matuka told the People’s Paper. He said no complaints have been raised with management about medicine shortages or rude staff.
