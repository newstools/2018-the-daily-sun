CAPE Town mayor Patricia de Lille may be in hot water after going to a memorial service for Mama Winnie on Wednesday.Apparently, the DA was angered by her attendance and speech at the event in Brandfort, Free State organised by the EFF and attended by ANC, DA and Azapo members.At the memorial, De Lille said Mama Winnie was fearless. “In 1995, I went with her to Beijing for a conference. Winnie was ill treated and the next day I left. For me, it was a matter of principle.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstMRAs3qJjwWRoUHB3v5sZm1UMaFV4mqgIVev3LEsV923LxHKBUQ2XC4jdPTT9Z02ciR_JZESzBFSx68C5o-Xq7qfhTM2IWIJ8ZTx4OaChPhfWh7evs1UaQP7iEoOCewxOVt3WD6fa1d-2Gly_mZq1kX43XzMADLMeQ-h7oQEcmAIn2ag7cqTP7pwDHPy3WQHVdLkvkKDl6JOxZGoO4MzZ7a5pOgfOhKVTBfXycrD1FBZcONQMVmBQ5v4PsDXf8oBtoodYfLIpjJA0iIKq5knVZ5OwWF7kd\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIr181UO8LuyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She has respect for Winnie.” Party spokeswoman Refiloe Nt’sekhe said reports of the DA charging De Lille for attending the EFF service were not true.“ A call to inform us about attending would have been welcomed. We sent Free State leader Patricia Kopane.”But according to a Free State DA member, De Lille does face questions about attending the event.
