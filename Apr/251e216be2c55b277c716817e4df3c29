FRUSTRATED bus commuters were left standing in long queues as taxis came up short against the increased number of commuters. The bus drivers’ strike over wages started on Wednesday and ongoing negotiations resulted in the CCMA being roped in for intervention. Numsa spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said they hoped for a speedy resolution. “We apologise to commuters for the inconvenience, but unfortunately we have been forced into this course of action,” she said. Refiloe Kobe ((23) from Soweto said she feared she might lose her job. “My boss does not buy into issues of the taxis. The lines are hectic. I woke up very early but I am late,” she said. Ntombifikile Tshabalala (56) of KwaDwesi, Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun: “I always take a bus to Greenacres and it costs me R12,50. Today I have to take a taxi to Ziyabuya for R11 and another one to Greenacres for R16. I will pay R27 instead of R12,50. This is too much.” Cape Chamber of Commerce president Janine Myburgh called on employers to be patient with workers who arrive late.
