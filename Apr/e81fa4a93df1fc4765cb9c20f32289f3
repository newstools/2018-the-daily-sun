The family of former minister Zola Skweyiya issued a
statement on Wednesday saying they had heard of his death through the media. "The family regrets the unfortunate leak of his death
to the media before his family members and his organisation, the ANC were informed,"
said family spokesperson Khulu Mbatha.He said while Sweyiya's wife, Thuthukile Skweyiya, was aware
of her husband's death most family members who were with him on Tuesday night,
including Mbatha himself, were not aware that he had died.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssu88vrV60J3JQyvfu_XDvtXP71I2qL4jx_Dy8pQ-4PsI8-J-lS8eGjBQNkz2m1nmrWEEKDROLPOXSCmHJpPGw47Dca2dqVRnqeRfTQqmsQ4ILxb7nLLjI8C0Dq6A6zY4mvqBCYjZjFgKzK4cVzooawTvTndPyRpLssS3hBwvQOfFRg9Sgx0SNas51fg8lDVYTJl1zrSMv5fA9NY7-dMpNVmf_2qxPSc2Eeadbt3YjQDgkeGzbMK4FBzgGEGmg-4R15Kok9cT9Wl_g4yCgkfsSsx5A3DaE5\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDEsFjNsPx1-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

come to the hospital, but before he got there he heard about Skweyiya's death
on the radio.However, he told News24 that the family didn't blame the
media for how the news came out. It's just a consequence of advanced
technology, he said.The well-known politician died in hospital at the age of 75
after a long illness on Wednesday."We are currently doing our best to contact the rest of
the family members that were not officially informed," said Mbatha."We are aware that many ANC leaders and members,
including the president of the ANC, comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, former presidents
Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe, had indicated that they will be paying [his
family] a visit today. Unfortunately, his departure shocked all of us."Skweyiya served as minister of public service and
administration in former Nelson Mandela's Cabinet and as minister of social
development in the Mbeki administration.He then retired from Parliament in 2009 and took up the
position of South Africa's high commissioner to London.SOURCE: NEWS24
