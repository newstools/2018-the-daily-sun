The madala managed to untie himself and walked to the road where a passerby gave him a lift to the Paul Roux cop shop.“He was taken to the nearest hospital for medical treatment as his injuries were life threatening,” said Mbambo.New Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsie Sempe condemned the attack on the farmer, especially since he is elderly. Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects is urged to call Detective-Sergeant Freddie Brits on 073 289 2769.
