FOR over a year, gogo Zandile Radebe (78) has been plagued by unauthorised deductions from her grant.Her daughter, Nonhlanhla Radebe (33) from Molweni, west of Durban, said they were about to consult the South African Social Security Agency when the gogo was sent to hospital.“She spent eight months in hospital because of severe diabetes and only came back home last month. She used what was left of her grant to buy healthy food on doctor’s instructions. She was left with no money to hire a car to take her to the nearest Sassa office,” said Nonhlanhla.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvDqugjhKckZC_rxRZ_XfuGomHW0wQhrIKhQJNpPc9124kPUwfwpsuij1P42lqw5f39vzxXl66ML3qiSzTy8zJnQAKKgTPTeZIHForcxLphEQC2IE_IfyjB-dmtY8rRcYoPoiN-cosm0FYBF7aviZPGvhMlU2l6SmnlnEL2ZlNShOBGHdOKUoYauOkkMYXIz14tlhXIFQkeLIS6upxgk81ElESWrgnaq7idXc9zNx6WpRAh7L8z0SVAmtwy6g2QgMlWKwgZYgMalZwkOTjyMSVcbgpESCj9\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNEPeosPDRq6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

If I was working, the deductions would not make a difference. I don’t know where I will get more money.”She said gogo Zandile should be getting about R1 500 but gets only R700 to R800, which is a huge cut for someone who relies on her grant for everything. Zanele said she suspected her mum might have borrowed money from mashonisas who targeted gogos and madalas at pay points. “I don’t know what else to think because that’s the only explanation that makes sense. When we asked her if she borrowed money from someone, she denied doing so,” said Nonhlanhla. KZN Sassa spokesman Vusi Mahaye said: “The only way for them to find out what is happening with the gogo’s grant is to visit the nearest Sassa branch.”
