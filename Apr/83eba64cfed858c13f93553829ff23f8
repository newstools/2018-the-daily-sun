They only say: 'Zuma is corrupt.'"Zuma thanked the crowd for supporting him, as they had previously.He claimed he was innocent, even though he was being treated like a criminal.''Our country's Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. However, there are some people, even people whom I trusted, who have judged me as guilty already. The truth will be revealed in time.''"Your presence here shows that you understand the Constitution and law that well."Zuma belted out Umshini Wam (Bring me my machine gun) before he left the court.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/they-will-regret-reinstating-these-charges-zuma-20180406
