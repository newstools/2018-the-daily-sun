WAR is brewing between the National Association of Funeral Parlours and a breakaway group, the Combined National Funeral Parlour Association.Things turned ugly at the weekend when the offices of the Combined National Funeral Parlour Association in Gale Street, Durban caught fire in the early hours of Saturday morning. The association blames its rival for it. A source close to both associations said the fire on Saturday happened after the National Association of Funeral Parlours accused its rival of bewitching its members. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv4YQUdeJeUmMxo7N1LWSZ6_JzqVTvbI-B9g19QqImB-lLnBSi7Xe0WFp3_KfsBXtKK-8sc5NFNZdSTzrV0foYouLs58D-ooLJUtKW_LDMaVcUz7WVoJg2qid6T5hZRA8OPwzSRpP-OINMCbHqU-zeMtNwooFVojOXMfzMIKpEpY5fBmtlRoDTT-x5h7xIUadeImxT89q-Xm8MqE_BJxA7m1tYd4UBK01CMIxJDWpx6HcCytTr3Y8OpLN2SoP_roiFd2rvX8r9LuPqzPPEr8Mso1Eg9tA0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEIAzrjjutOpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She said the witchcraft allegations were made after leaders of the National Association of Funeral Parlours were involved in a car accident in Kostad, southern KZN two weeks ago. Executive member Bongani Magwaza died and three other leaders, including president Ruben Maseko, were injured.“This industry is operating like the taxi business now. If nothing is done to bring peace between the two organisations, we will soon start burying people,” said the source. Combined National Funeral Parlour Association spokesman Nkululeko Ndlovu said firefighters put out the flames but the office was damaged. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. He confirmed that one person died in an accident in Kokstad.
