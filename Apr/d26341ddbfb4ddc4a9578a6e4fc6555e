Malabi-Dzhangi said the victim accompanied him since Malatjie is well-known
traditional healer. She said once in the bushes Malatjie turned violent and
assaulted her until she became weak and that's when he rape her. He then carried her to his homestead where he continued
to rape her and kept her there until the next morning.During the trial, Malatjie pleaded not guilty and he
claimed that the complainant had consented to the sexual intercourse. The court
rejected his version and found him guilty as charged.During sentencing, Advocate Masehela Makgomothi, argued
that the court has to consider that the accused betrayed the trust that the
complainant had in him as her traditional healer. He further argued that it was more aggravating that the
complainant was raped more than once and she was also inflicted with injuries
during the incident. The Court agreed with the state and sentenced the
Malatjie to life imprisonment. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate Ivy
ThengaÂ  said women and children are not
safe in their communities therefore the sentence would go a long way in sending
a loud message that violence against women and children will not be tolerated .
