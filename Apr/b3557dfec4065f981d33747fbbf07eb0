Dash, real name Mthokozisi Mkhathini, has left the Dreamteam.Fans of the group were left wondering what happened to the third member after Saso and Trey, real names Lusaso Ngcobo and Trevor Sineke, announced the return of Dreamteam on Instagram with Dash nowhere to be seen in any of the pictures.What further puzzled the fans was that Dash's Twitter and Instagram accounts had no word on the return of Dreamteam like on Saso and Trey's pages.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst-joHcsyRD8pnqe_Y4PpHUU72K8DX3xpBfLhXW4o-EyF9rcyaaRDKpLm9u191ZKTj5N2M-C2p5pEV7t7HnrRppltaLqYI9Ri39kY1CaAsGIXoq1P_RBQLy0g4XkAXz9szEBrcKVbVxHkRt0OcAReWnFyOKO3w8keN9n4Fi72ydeqtoCv5EznYSPj8rxVxzuOdKI8SvtClkWYiw20bkQCS5fQ1Xj_oqyk4VaTrWkbVJ2XaAXBSIuTCp5ECU5xIJ8tRDCDME97cLCTA0hd9qnzqpgdEt3X6rSUi6bsM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBGiKuv_K6TTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
