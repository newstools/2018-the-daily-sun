Maria Makonye (47) said she was the first motorist at the scene. “I went to check if the driver was okay. He wasn’t injured but when I learnt that he was drunk I started to help myself to the tomatoes just to teach him a lesson. “How do you feel sorry for people who don’t respect the rules of the road?

They didn’t care about what had happened,” said Maria.Motorist stopped taking the tomatoes when a man believed to be the driver’s relative, arrived at the scene and threatened them. Another driver, Phillip Makwe (28) said he thought there was a big pile-up when he saw the cars on the road.“I then saw people picking up spilled tomatoes on the road and I joined in. “I took enough to share with my family in Ga-Maleboho,” he said.
