Maria Makonye (47) said she was the first motorist at the scene. “I went to check if the driver was okay. He wasn’t injured but when I learnt that he was drunk I started to help myself to the tomatoes just to teach him a lesson. “How do you feel sorry for people who don’t respect the rules of the road? Lots of vehicles stopped and joined us. They didn’t care about what had happened,” said Maria.Motorist stopped taking the tomatoes when a man believed to be the driver’s relative, arrived at the scene and threatened them. Another driver, Phillip Makwe (28) said he thought there was a big pile-up when he saw the cars on the road.“I then saw people picking up spilled tomatoes on the road and I joined in. “I took enough to share with my family in Ga-Maleboho,” he said.
