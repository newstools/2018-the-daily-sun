But everything is alright now," Mafumbu added.He said it was important for Ndlovu to "dust himself off" and move forward. "The first thing we need to do is reconstruct the brand, which is Brickz. There were a lot of things that were put on hold because of this case."He is a firm believer in Ndlovu's innocence, but was acknowledged that, in the end, "the [court] must decide what is true and what is not true".Ndlovu's lawyer Piet du Plessis said his client would maintain his innocence and added that they had a good case on appeal. In July 2017, the court found Brickz guilty of raping a 16-year-old at his home in November 2013.He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in October 2017.Last month, the South Gauteng High Court granted him leave to appeal. A date has not been set for the appeal.While he is out in bail, Ndlovu must surrender all his passports and travel documents. He has also been prohibited from entering international ports.In addition, he cannot leave Johannesburg without informing the investigating officer and must report to the Jabulani police station every Monday and Wednesday.Du Plessis said Ndlovu was allowed to perform.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/we-will-rebuild-the-brickz-brand-family-of-kwaito-star-20180406
