The annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was in its second week and more Mzansi celebs made an appearance. After Thando Thabethe, Enhle Mbali and Khuli Chana amongst others attended the first weekend of the festival, more Mzansi celebrities including Minnie Dlamini and Terry Phetho also decided to join in on the fun on the second weekend. Fashion designer Thula Sindi was also at the festival while Tshepo ‘Howza’ Mosese and his wife Salamina turned it into a stunning baecation in the California deserts.   Day 3 #Coachella2018 ??
