Apart from her writing, directing and scriptwriting exploits, Thishiwe Ziqubu is one of the best young talents in the acting space right now and her work speaks for itself. The 32 year old has worked on many local hit movies such as Tell Me Sweet Something and Hard to Get to name a few. However, despite all her talent she still gets discriminated against because of her sexuality, about which she is very open and unapologetic. It is not a secret that she is gay and in a happy relationship with her partner Mandisa Nduna and in a recent interview on Trending SA, she spoke about the concept of “coming out” as a gay person saying it is something she has never had to do. "Coming out as a concept is very homophobic in itself. Heterosexual people don't come out. Nobody has ever had to say; 'Ma, I'm straight'. So, why is it that if I love women I have to say; 'Ma, I'm gay.' It is just to make straight people comfortable. I have never had to come out. I have just lived as myself," she said. Thishiwe also added that she could not stand homophobic people who use God to support their barbaric behaviour. "It is disgusting how people feel that it is okay to take from someone, to rob them, to rape them, to attack them or even spew hate speech because they differ from you. Who gave you the right? Who gave you the right to decide that God, people like to put God in these things, who said only a man and woman can love each other?"
