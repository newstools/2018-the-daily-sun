I resisted but became so ill that I almost died. When I started buying and wearing the clothes she chose, I became better.“I even have a few panties, but I dress like a man when I work as a security guard,” he said. Asked about his love life, he said he had a new girlfriend and was still getting to know her.“I broke up with another woman in 2015. No woman has ever had a problem with the way I dress,” he said.One of Mazibuko’s neighbours, Xolani Mngoma (34) said: “At first I thought he was gay but I have since found out that he is a sangoma.”Cultural expert Professor Jabulani Maphalala didn’t deny that the ancestors sometimes made unusual demands, but said it was very unusual for a male sangoma to dress like a woman.
