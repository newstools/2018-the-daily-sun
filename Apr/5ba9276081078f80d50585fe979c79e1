All the teams fighting for the play-offs still have to play tough matches. So we are not giving up. He added: “We are not blaming anyone for our current situation. We have to rectify it ourselves. All we need to do is try to give players the necessary confidence boost.” Tshakhuma’s poor form of the last month has seen them drop from second place to sixth in the table after they lost three league matches in a row.Chokoe also dismissed stories that some of his players are not fully committed as they are rumoured to have signed pre-contracts with Absa Premiership teams.“No, nothing of the sort,” he said. “All my players are committed to the team. “Their attitude is impressive despite the defeats. We are not going to point fingers at players. “We are a team and we work together to achieve our goal of qualifying for the play-offs.” Tshakhuma will be competing for the play-offs spot with the likes of Witbank Spurs, Real Kings, Jomo Cosmos and their Venda rivals Black Leopards, who are all above them in the standings. Tshakhuma face Cosmos, who are three points ahead of them, in their next league match at Vosloorus Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm).
