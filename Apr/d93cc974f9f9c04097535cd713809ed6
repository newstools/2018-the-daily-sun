Dhlomo said the machines can be used by general doctors and  don’t require cancer specialists to operate them. KZN Health’s head of obstetrics and gynaecology, Dr Neil Moran, said cervical cancer caused by the human papillomavirus was common. The virus is sexually transmitted. “A large proportion of young sexually active people are infected,” Moran told the People’s Paper.
