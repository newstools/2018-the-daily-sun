MARITZBURG United players are not shaken by the threat posed by the star-studded Mamelodi Sundowns. The teams face off in the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup at Pietermaritzburg’s Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday (3pm). The Team of Choice are well aware that they are just one win away from making history by playing in the domestic league cup final for the first time. Siphesihle Ndlovu understands what a big achievement it would be if they were to beat on-form Sundowns. Said Ndlovu: “We are looking forward to playing Sundowns and know very well that it won’t be easy for either team. “Although we know they are a good team, I think they too know very well that they can’t take us lightly. “All we think about is playing in the final. History awaits us.” These two teams have already met in a cup competition this season and United won that match 1-0, beating Sundowns in front of their own fans in the MTN8 quarterfinals. Ndlovu said Sundowns should also be wary of them with that in mind. “We will fight until the last whistle. What happened in the past remains there but I know it will still be on their minds. “The match won’t be easy but we need to come out winners. We are playing at home and have been doing well. We need to keep that good record,” added Ndlovu. The 21-year-old, who spoke to SunSport at the team’s training session yesterday, has been a revelation for the Team of Choice this season. He knows other teams will now target him on the field. But he says he intends to keep pushing himself. “The only thing you can do when you are being targeted is to remain calm. Players will do that just to put you off your game and if you retaliate, you will lose focus. For me, the key is to keep my calm and make sure I stay focused.”
