THOSE who visit Saulsville Hostel in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, don’t have to stop and ask for directions. They can simply follow the stinking smell and their noses will lead them straight to the hostel. Saulsville Hostel dwellers have even renamed the hostel Kak City! They said they were sick and tired of the manhole that keeps on leaking sewage and spilling from their overflowing and blocked communal toilets. When Daily Sun visited the hostel yesterday, the smell greeted us long before we saw residents. Raw sewage runs everywhere and hostel dwellers keep to the paths to avoid stepping in the river of sewage. Angry residents said their pain was made worse by the fact that their ward councillor, Mthobeni Celiphila, lived with them but he has failed to do anything to change their situation. Refilwe Madithapa (36) said they have complained several times to the councillor without getting any help. “He told us to hire a plumber to fix the toilets,” said Refilwe. “We begged him to report the matter to the municipality but he told us that we are ungrateful because we live in free houses and yet we demand so much.” Another resident Masello Moleko (40) claimed the councillor refuses to meet them anymore. “He is tired of us but won’t resign as our representative,” she said. Councillor Celiphila said he was busy trying to fix the problem. He denied that he told residents to fix the toilets themselves. “I invited municipal directors who came to witness the condition we are living in early in February. “Residents saw the officials too, so I’m surprised when they say I’m doing nothing about it. “I’m also meeting with the director of housing in the City over the issue,” he said.
