PEOPLE living with disabilities from all over Durban say that they are tired of being excluded when companies and eThekwini Municipality are filling jobs. They said what angered them most was that many companies ignored policies and obligations to employ people living with disabilities. They told the US consul general Sherry Sykes that South African companies in the public and private sector also had buildings that couldn’t accommodate them. They accused companies of using this as an excuse not to employ them. The group met Sykes at her house in Durban North last week. Sphamandla Gumbi (40), who is in a wheelchair, said it angered him to talk about the same issues again and again. “The problem with South Africa is that we talk too much, with no action. We need to start acting now. Both the private and public sector need offices that accommodate disabled workers.” He said that they were tired of begging companies to hire them. They also wanted sponsors to invest in them and help them start their own businesses so that they’ll be able to hire other people living with disabilities. eThekwini municipal head of human resources, Kim Makhathini, said the municipality was already implementing policies to hire disabled people. Sykes said everyone who was part of the discussion should go out with an obligation to change the mindset of people and to fix the problem.
