INGQUZA Hill mayor Patrick Mdingi has been arrested for contempt of court.    The municipality failed to provide housing to residents whose homes were unlawfully demolished  in 2016.    The Grahamstown High Court first issued an order in  October of that year for the municipality to build temporary homes in Slovo Park, about 5km from New Rest in Lusikisiki, where the homes were demolished.     But the resi dents didn’t occupy the new dwellings  and instead filed another application.   if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv0icpn0LkVY-6yhSTYSS3e3VA9AGvDKSfNs6ZNfCc1cK36acrUFeID1yS3Iu1Lc4fv1v46ct1pdknlFoao9pcZ1Mnkef03LoCpIfNJ7Oz2KfrOEZkwVjlmp7iq15GrsRdM-UeBOoYariALBdrt-M2O5w6BzXUw4KT1nWGKb7t9U5GepgNTOP47YTcD7Rqjy1dkgPWz4XZiG1s7Ec40MjlPpo6THtkHy1XBUScx4eOi7l43fSb2XMM05AKHm95Pucpvw2mjroHoNvzeSekL5TEXr_sHI3GW\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKsQQ8WMhxxGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Lusikisiki court sheriff Zanele Nqezo said: “Mdingi was arrested at his home and municipal manager Mluleki Fihlani has not been arrested. These officials are to serve 30 days in jail.”   Ayanda Mfolozi, whose house was demolished, said the arrest proved that no one is above the law.   Municipal spokesmanZamuxolo Mathwasa said they heard about the arrest but couldn’t comment further.
