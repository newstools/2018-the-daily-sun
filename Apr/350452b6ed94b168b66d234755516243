The hospital has all the information in my file.” He has now demanded that the health department intervene.Health spokesman Agiza Hlongwane said: “We’ve been informed by the hospital the patient was assessed by a doctor employed by Sassa. Kindly contact Sassa for comment.”Sassa spokesman Vusi Mahaye said: “There’s nothing we can do without that letter. If his doctor says he’s fine, there’s nothing we can do.” Samukele’s family now survives on five child support grants. His wife is unemployed.
