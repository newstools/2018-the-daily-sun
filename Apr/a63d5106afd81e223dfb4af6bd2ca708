But a leaking pipe in her yard is steadily bringing an end to her happiness. Worried Tselane from Dipotomaneng in Clocolan, Free State, said the leak caused the walls of her RDP to crack. She said she feared that the house could collapse if the municipality doesn’t fix it soon. She has reported the matter to the Setsoto Local Municipality several times, but nothing has happened. She said the water also damages her furniture. “Soon I won’t have a house. It’s going to fall apart,” she said. The gogo said she sometimes uses a spade to spread dry soil around the house, but that doesn’t help as it soon turns to mud. “If the municipality can’t help me, what should I do?” said gogo Tselane. “I can’t live like this. They need to do something.” Setsoto spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said that Tselane failed to provide a reference number, proof that she had reported the leak to them. “We urge her to come forward so that the municipality can attend to the matter,” said Gaba.
