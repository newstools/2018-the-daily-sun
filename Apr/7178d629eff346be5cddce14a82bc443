A GROUP of referees from Lwandle, Strand, are angry. The match officials say they have to use their own money to buy kit. “We love helping out and officiating, but we need assistance with kit. We want to look presentable,” said referee Siyanda Hola. Soccer teams are doing their bit by giving the officials some money after each game. “But it is not enough. We use that money to buy food,” said Siyanda. Luthando Fatyela, another referee, said a lack of sponsorship makes many think twice about becoming referees. “We want to train a lot of young people, but they get discouraged when they see us wearing torn clothes. If residents or business owners helped us with funding, we would perform our duties with pride.” Soccer fan Luyolo Njabathwa said that match officials play a crucial role. “Without them, there is no beautiful game. They are always forgotten when teams get sponsorships. “That needs to change. We should appreciate these guys and invest in them,” said Luyolo. The referees are calling on all good Samaritans to help them purchase new kit. Siyanda said: “I know there are people who are willing to help. After we go public, we will receive something. We are also calling on people who want to learn how to officiate to come to us so we can train them.”
