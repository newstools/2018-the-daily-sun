PUPILS at Sibanesihle High School in Mgwagwa Village, KZN Midlands are not happy with their school building. They claim that since December, they have been attending lessons in damaged classrooms. The pupils said seven classrooms were damaged by heavy storms last year. “While three classrooms have no roofs, four others are leaking and don’t have windows. The doors are also broken,” said a pupil. Another pupil said before the schools closed for the December holidays, the principal promised he would arrange with the education department to deliver mobile classrooms. “But that has not happened. “The principal only moved matric pupils to better classrooms. “We can’t learn at this school. The department should know that we are suffering,” said the pupil. Scelo Khuzwayo, spokesman for the KZN Education MEC, said Sibanesihle was one of several other schools in the province that were damaged by heavy rain last year. “The department has completed all the necessary procedures that precede the start of the repairs. “The repairs to the school will begin soon.” Khuzwayo said the department wouldn’t want the pupils to learn in such bad conditions. “We encourage the school principals to request mobile classrooms from the department if the damage is too great. “Regarding the issue of Sibanesihle, I can’t confirm if they made a request because the department is represented at various levels. “I’ll have to find out from their district or circuit office,” he said.
