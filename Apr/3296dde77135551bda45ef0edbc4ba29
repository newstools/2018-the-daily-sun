We hope many more convictions will follow.“Like most residents of Glebelands old blocks, Sibongile had been living in fear of hitmen who control those blocks,” said Burger. She said it was even more shocking that women had become targets for Glebelands assassinations.According to her records, nearly 80 people have been killed in the hostel since March 2014. She said despite all these killings, there have been only three convictions.Daily Sun has reported on Glebelands residents’ suffering and the lack of arrests and convictions in murder cases numerous times. The killings allegedly arise from a battle over beds.KZN acting provincial commissioner, Major Bheki Langa, praised police for their hard work in ensuring Khayelihle’s sentence. “We were blamed and not given enough time to thoroughly investigate these cases. Now our hard work has yielded positive results and the sentence will serve as a warning to other criminals who terrorise hostel residents,” he said.
