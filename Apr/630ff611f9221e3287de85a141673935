GOVERNMENT is trying hard to deliver housing to all and improve the lives of those who live in shacks. And even though squatter camps are popping up faster than housing projects, those who are given new homes are grateful. Human Settlements Minister Nomaindia Mfeketo put a smile on the faces of about 2 000 citizens when she officially opened the R300-million Thembelihle Village housing project in Tshwane yesterday. The project was a partnership between her department, the Gauteng human settlements branch and the City of Tshwane. The newly launched family units come with a communal swimming pool, lawns and sports facilities. The project has 733 units with 2 000 occupants, including children. Construction started in 2014 and ended this year. Mfeketo, who toured the units with a number of delegates, said the department was building affordable social housing. She said the units could be rented or purchased. Tshwane’s Mayor Solly Msimanga said: “We are breaking the apartheid norm of people living far from where they work. These new houses will accommodate people close to their places of employment,” he said. Msimanga said the city would identify more vacant land and convert it into useful buildings such as low-cost houses for the poor. Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Dikgang Moiloa said the department will roll out more massive building projects. One of the beneficiaries, Thulani Mhlwana (26), said he was happy to move into his new home. “This place is the best. It is spacious and security is tight. It is perfect for people living with disabilities.” Thulani previously lived in block VV in Soshanguve.
