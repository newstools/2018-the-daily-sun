TENDAI Ndoro case looks like it will continue dragging on as there was no final decision taken on Thursday. Ndoro's eligibility to play for Ajax Cape Town case was back in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Thursday, but the arguments continue on Friday before judgment, which could be on Monday. Ajax came to court seeking to set aside a decision taken by Safa arbitrator Nassir Cassim, SC, on 28 March  that the PSL dispute resolution chamber (DRC) did not have jurisdiction to handle the matter, hence it was referred to Fifa. In response, Fifa players status committee last week ruled that they do not have jurisdiction on the matter and referred it back to ‘the competent authorities in South Africa’. The dispute emerged from Ndoro's eligibility after the Zimbabwean international featured in official matches for three clubs in one season, Orlando Pirates, Al Faisaly of Saudi Arabia and Ajax Cape Town which is in contravention of Fifa rules which states that a player can be registered by three clubs in one season but can only play for two. In January the PSL DRC ruled in favour of Ajax that Ndoro was eligible to play for them. If Ajax win the case, it would revive the DRC's verdict that Ndoro is eligible to play and the PSL will most likely appeal again and the matter will go back to Safa for arbitration, but this time to deal with the merits of the case and a decision will be taken from there. If it happens they lose the case, they are likely to be docked points from the matches in which Ndoro played. In all, he played eight matches and Ajax collected 10 points in those games.
