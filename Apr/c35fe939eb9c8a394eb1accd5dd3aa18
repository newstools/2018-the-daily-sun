THE man known as the Facebook rapist and serial killer briefly appeared in the Qumbu Magistrates Court yesterday morning. He chose to abandon his bail application after neighbours and families of the victims protested outside the court. Heavily armed cops escorted the 29-year-old accused into a packed court. The man was arrested in November. He faces four counts of rape, three of murder and three of robbery with aggravating circumstances. The accused apparently posted false information on Facebook to get women to fall in love with him. He would invite them out and pretend to have someone fetch them, claiming he was busy somewhere. He allegedly also sent them transport money via Shoprite Money Market. The victims were from East London, Alice, Mthatha, Tsolo, Ntabankulu and Mount Fletcher. Prosecutor Bulelani Bidla asked for the accused to be kept behind bars. He also suggested that the case return to court in August, but the magistrate postponed it to July. This was after the accusedâ€™s lawyer called for a court date in June. NPA regional spokesman Luxolo Tyali said the senior public prosecutor had made further findings. He said there were some touch-ups that needed to be compiled.
