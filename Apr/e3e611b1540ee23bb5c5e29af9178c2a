BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt was his usual guarded self after he watched his team get played off the park by PSL champions-elect Mamelodi Sundowns this weekend. They lost the Absa Premiership clash at Loftus Versfeld 2-0, with Themba Zwane and Sibusiso Vilakazi on target for Downs. Hunt was not pleased with players’ below-par performance, as both goals were scored on the back of individual errors. The hard-to-please coach said: “These players are playing for their jobs. I hope they know that.” After expressing clear disappointment with his players’ showing, Hunt complained that he did not have depth in his squad ahead of their Caf Confederation Cup clash with Nigerian powerhouses Enyimba in the West African country on Wednesday. The Clever Boys flew out to Nigeria to face the two-times Champions League winners in the second leg of their play-off game. Their first leg clash at Milpark Stadium ended in a 1-1 draw. Wits have also lost back-to-back league games to Ajax Cape Town and Sundowns. Hunt was evasive about the possibility of Wits finishing the season in the top eight. He said: “Our season has been poor. “We haven’t done well. The trip to Nigeria does not help us either. We don’t have depth, it’s crazy. We have to come back on Friday and play on Sunday. “Africa has not helped us – we don’t have the resources to play in it.”
