THE Methodist Church's Bishop Gary Ravis calls struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela "Mama", a name many who feel they owe her a debt of gratitude for the country's freedom call her.However, he is often chastised for doing so and in the wake of her death has even received death threats for calling her an icon.He told News24 that he had received more than 20 threatening phone calls. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvcfbDK5yoovwN-quFswTeJeI_DzBowC-fxKP7iM6G4p_rgDTF3e19fv5npteWFFCFvOHWnGvEwI1UYp12CI4AwWOZM5ZxWEfYvb8dlckGHF_wtBpGq-pUmIKTBtbt0PPVJaIBDsyEHHBiONl4SW4EKK34x0Vj3y_dryfG0HYm0_Bn-W6QhQ1e8vDw9UCdc7vC-fK6hxSYXWsRLHnuDdUa0Mjde9zeFHAb6aSFvZ8ASbwOPfk_Awypz5ZXHrWQU9f-Y0xNzmJVGKCigYWrz14yzwAMSaVU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzG5H0Oruv8lsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

For some people it's beyond comprehension [that I had a relationship with her]. It goes both ways, black and white," Ravis said in reaction to the backlash against his views.Ravis first met Madikizela-Mandela in the late 1990s while he was stationed in Soweto and has grown to see himself as one of her many sons, and was one of the last people to have seen her on the day she drew her last breath.An ardent churchgoerThe 81-year-old stalwart died on Easter Monday in hospital following a long illness."She was completely at peace, she was fine. The one thing about Mama, no matter how many times you went to visit her, I can tell you now that she never spoke about herself or her illness. She would discuss anything except the state which she was in – she completely deflected anything about what condition she was in," he said of the liberation hero.Ravis admitted that he had felt some worry for Madikizela-Mandela's health, but assumed that in keeping with her fighting spirit she would be back on her feet soon – but that was not the case.The bishop's insights into the lesser known parts of the global icon's life echoed those of family representatives and ANC leaders – not only had she refused to move from her beloved Soweto, but she was also an ardent churchgoer.During Easter weekend her granddaughter Zoleka Mandela posted pictures of Madikizela-Mandela in the red, black and white of the Methodist Church after they had attended a service.SOURCE: NEWS24
