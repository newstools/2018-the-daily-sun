But he struggled to obtain a regular place in Randers which led to a six-month loan move to SuperSport United in January last year.The former Bafana Bafana player returned to Denmark in July last year hoping to take his career to greater heights only to return home miserable.Said the source: “Masango’s been around for seven months now. He had a problem in Denmark as they were no longer paying for his accommodation. He asked management to return home.”But Masango has himself to blame for his fate. He turned down an offer to join Cape Town City in January.Added the source: “City management were prepared to pay him a good salary, but he turned it down. Pirates assistant Rhulani Mokoena had shown some interest, but the chairman wasn’t prepared to sign him.”Asked for comment, Masango said: “I’m not prepared to talk right now. I’ll call you when I’m ready.”
